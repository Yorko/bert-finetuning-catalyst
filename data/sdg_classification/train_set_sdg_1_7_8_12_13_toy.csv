84895022699,13,"GIS-based risk assessment for the Nile Delta coastal zone under different sea level rise scenarios case study: Kafr EL Sheikh Governorate, Egypt",GIS Inundation Sea level rise,"Sea level changes are caused by several natural phenomena, including mainly ocean thermal expansion, glacial melt from Greenland and Antarctica. It was estimated, in this respect, that global average sea level rose, during the 20th Century, by at least 10 cm. This trend is expected to continue and most likely accelerated during the 21st Century due to human-induced global warming. Global average sea level is expected to rise, by the year 2100, due to global warming between 0.18 and 0.59 cm. Such a rise in sea-level will significantly impact coastal areas due to the high concentration of natural and socioeconomic activities and assets located along the coast. The northern coastal zone of the Nile Delta is generally low land, and is consequently vulnerable to direct and indirect impacts of sea level rise (SLR) due to climate changes, particularly inundation. Despite the uncertainty associated with developed scenarios for climate change and expected SLR, there is a need, according to precautionary approach, to assess and analyze the impacts of SLR. Such an assessment, on one hand, can assist in formulating effective adaptation options to specific, sometimes localized, impacts of SLR. On the other hand, such an analysis can contribute significantly to the development of integrated approach to deal with the impacts of SLR. The objective of this paper is to assess and spatially analyze the risks of expected sea level rise (SLR), in particular inundation, and its implications up to the year 2100 in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate, Egypt, using GIS techniques. For that purpose, a GIS was developed for the study area and then utilized to identify the spatial extent of those areas that would be vulnerable to inundation by SLR. Moreover, various land uses/land covers susceptible to such inundation were identified. Results indicate that more than 22.59 % and 24.50 % of the total area of Kafr El Sheikh Governorate would be vulnerable to inundation under B1 and A1FI (IPCC most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios), respectively. No significant difference was noticed between the two scenarios in terms of spatial extent of SLR impacts. It was also found that a significant proportion of these areas were found to be currently either undeveloped or wetlands. Moreover, it was found that about 90.13 % of the vulnerable areas are actually less exposed to the risks of SLR due to the existence of a number of man-made features, not intended as protection measures, e.g. International Coastal Highway, that can be used to limit the areas vulnerable to inundations by SLR. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2013.","[TITLE] gis-based risk assessment for the nile delta coastal zone under different sea level rise scenarios case study: kafr el sheikh governorate, egypt [KEYWORDS] gis inundation sea level rise [ABSTRACT] sea level changes are caused by several natural phenomena, including mainly ocean thermal expansion, glacial melt from greenland and antarctica. it was estimated, in this respect, that global average sea level rose, during the 20th century, by at least 10 cm. this trend is expected to continue and most likely accelerated during the 21st century due to human-induced global warming. global average sea level is expected to rise, by the year 2100, due to global warming between 0.18 and 0.59 cm. such a rise in sea-level will significantly impact coastal areas due to the high concentration of natural and socioeconomic activities and assets located along the coast. the northern coastal zone of the nile delta is generally low land, and is consequently vulnerable to direct and indirect impacts of sea level rise (slr) due to climate changes, particularly inundation. despite the uncertainty associated with developed scenarios for climate change and expected slr, there is a need, according to precautionary approach, to assess and analyze the impacts of slr. such an assessment, on one hand, can assist in formulating effective adaptation options to specific, sometimes localized, impacts of slr. on the other hand, such an analysis can contribute significantly to the development of integrated approach to deal with the impacts of slr. the objective of this paper is to assess and spatially analyze the risks of expected sea level rise (slr), in particular inundation, and its implications up to the year 2100 in kafr el sheikh governorate, egypt, using gis techniques. for that purpose, a gis was developed for the study area and then utilized to identify the spatial extent of those areas that would be vulnerable to inundation by slr. moreover, various land uses/land covers susceptible to such inundation were identified. results indicate that more than 22.59 % and 24.50 % of the total area of kafr el sheikh governorate would be vulnerable to inundation under b1 and a1fi (ipcc most optimistic and pessimistic scenarios), respectively. no significant difference was noticed between the two scenarios in terms of spatial extent of slr impacts. it was also found that a significant proportion of these areas were found to be currently either undeveloped or wetlands. moreover, it was found that about 90.13 % of the vulnerable areas are actually less exposed to the risks of slr due to the existence of a number of man-made features, not intended as protection measures, e.g. international coastal highway, that can be used to limit the areas vulnerable to inundations by slr. © springer science+business media dordrecht 2013."
84978997581,1,Ritual well-being: toward a social signaling model of religion and mental health,Costly signaling religion and mental health religion and self-control ritual self-control social signaling strength model subjective well-being,"Religion is positively correlated with subjective well-being across a variety of contexts, but convincing causal models are lacking. Some researchers have suggested that religion may boost self-control, and thus well-being, by requiring effortful rituals. This article proposes that costly signaling theory provides a vital explanatory tool for understanding these relationships. Signaling theories posit that religious adherents signal their commitment to religious collectives through difficult or anhedonic activities and rituals, creating a cost barrier for entry which protects religious communities against free riders. Because costly signaling behaviors require the inhibition of prepotent responses and intentional exposure to aversive stimuli, committed adherents build self-control over time. Subjective well-being is thus modeled as a longitudinal product of subjective investment in a religious social collective and the self-regulation abilities that emerge from signaling that investment. This emphasis on a feedback cycle driven by social signaling represents a novel contribution to investigations of religion and well-being. New longitudinal research in social investment theory and self-control lends the model conceptual credibility.","[TITLE] ritual well-being: toward a social signaling model of religion and mental health [KEYWORDS] costly signaling religion and mental health religion and self-control ritual self-control social signaling strength model subjective well-being [ABSTRACT] religion is positively correlated with subjective well-being across a variety of contexts, but convincing causal models are lacking. some researchers have suggested that religion may boost self-control, and thus well-being, by requiring effortful rituals. this article proposes that costly signaling theory provides a vital explanatory tool for understanding these relationships. signaling theories posit that religious adherents signal their commitment to religious collectives through difficult or anhedonic activities and rituals, creating a cost barrier for entry which protects religious communities against free riders. because costly signaling behaviors require the inhibition of prepotent responses and intentional exposure to aversive stimuli, committed adherents build self-control over time. subjective well-being is thus modeled as a longitudinal product of subjective investment in a religious social collective and the self-regulation abilities that emerge from signaling that investment. this emphasis on a feedback cycle driven by social signaling represents a novel contribution to investigations of religion and well-being. new longitudinal research in social investment theory and self-control lends the model conceptual credibility."

85072723300,13,Spinel oxides as coke-resistant supports for NiO-based oxygen carriers in chemical looping combustion of methane,Carbon capture Chemical looping Coke inhibition Methane Nickel oxide Spinel oxides,"Due to their high activity for methane conversion under a cyclic redox scheme, supported nickel oxides are among the most extensively investigated oxygen carrier materials for chemical looping combustion (CLC) and reforming (CLR) of methane. However, coke formation remains as a key challenge for Ni-containing oxygen carriers. The current study investigates the effect of reducible, spinel-structured supports to enhance coke resistance of NiO-based oxygen carriers. It was hypothesized that reducible supports capable of continued yet slow lattice oxygen donation in the presence of methane can actively retard coke formation on the surface of the oxygen carriers. To evaluate such effects, NiFe2O4, MgFe2O4, and BaFe2O4 are investigated as coke-resistant, reducible supports for NiO using mass spectrometry (MS) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) during chemical looping cycles. All three reducible supports were capable of continuous oxygen donation over an extended period of time (>40 min) without signs of coke formation. When used as supports for NiO, the resulting oxygen carriers showed no sign of carbon deposition under typical methane CLC environments. In comparison, NiO supported on inert MgAl2O4 exhibited significant coke formation after only 2.5 min. Moreover, NiO supported on NiFe2O4 and BaFe2O4 exhibited faster redox activity and higher oxygen carrying capacity when compared to the inert MgAl2O4-supported NiO. Detailed investigation of the reduction behavior of NiFe2O4-supported NiO revealed extensive solid-state reactions and Ni/Fe exchanges among the support, NiO, and newly formed phases. Specifically, initial weight loss in NiFe2O4-supported NiO was associated with reduction of the oxygen carrier to metallic Ni and Fe3O4 phases. Subsequent coke inhibition was attributed to the slow reduction of Fe3O4 and FeO phases. Multi-cyclic redox studies indicated that NiFe2O4-supported NiO gradually lost its redox activity. In comparison, both MgFe2O4- and BaFe2O4-supported NiO exhibited satisfactory redox stability, activity, and coke resistance.","[TITLE] spinel oxides as coke-resistant supports for nio-based oxygen carriers in chemical looping combustion of methane [KEYWORDS] carbon capture chemical looping coke inhibition methane nickel oxide spinel oxides [ABSTRACT] due to their high activity for methane conversion under a cyclic redox scheme, supported nickel oxides are among the most extensively investigated oxygen carrier materials for chemical looping combustion (clc) and reforming (clr) of methane. however, coke formation remains as a key challenge for ni-containing oxygen carriers. the current study investigates the effect of reducible, spinel-structured supports to enhance coke resistance of nio-based oxygen carriers. it was hypothesized that reducible supports capable of continued yet slow lattice oxygen donation in the presence of methane can actively retard coke formation on the surface of the oxygen carriers. to evaluate such effects, nife2o4, mgfe2o4, and bafe2o4 are investigated as coke-resistant, reducible supports for nio using mass spectrometry (ms) and thermogravimetric analysis (tga) during chemical looping cycles. all three reducible supports were capable of continuous oxygen donation over an extended period of time (>40 min) without signs of coke formation. when used as supports for nio, the resulting oxygen carriers showed no sign of carbon deposition under typical methane clc environments. in comparison, nio supported on inert mgal2o4 exhibited significant coke formation after only 2.5 min. moreover, nio supported on nife2o4 and bafe2o4 exhibited faster redox activity and higher oxygen carrying capacity when compared to the inert mgal2o4-supported nio. detailed investigation of the reduction behavior of nife2o4-supported nio revealed extensive solid-state reactions and ni/fe exchanges among the support, nio, and newly formed phases. specifically, initial weight loss in nife2o4-supported nio was associated with reduction of the oxygen carrier to metallic ni and fe3o4 phases. subsequent coke inhibition was attributed to the slow reduction of fe3o4 and feo phases. multi-cyclic redox studies indicated that nife2o4-supported nio gradually lost its redox activity. in comparison, both mgfe2o4- and bafe2o4-supported nio exhibited satisfactory redox stability, activity, and coke resistance."
85056146918,1,"Obesity, equity and choice",distributive justice paternalism political philosophy public health ethics,"Obesity is often considered a public health crisis in rich countries that might be alleviated by preventive regulations such as a sugar tax or limiting the density of fast food outlets. This paper evaluates these regulations from the point of view of equity. Obesity is in many countries correlated with socioeconomic status and some believe that preventive regulations would reduce inequity. The puzzle is this: how could policies that reduce the options of the badly off be more equitable? Suppose we distinguish: (1) the badly off have poor options from (2) the badly off are poor at choosing between their options (ie, have a choosing problem). If obesity is due to a poverty of options, it would be perverse to reduce them further. Some people in public health say that preventive regulations do not reduce options but, I shall argue, they are largely wrong. So the equity case for regulations depends on the worst off having a choosing problem. It also depends on their having a choosing problem that makes their choices against their interests. Perhaps they do. I ask, briefly, what the evidence has to say about whether the badly off choose against their interests. The evidence is thin but implies that introducing preventive regulations for the sake of equity would be at least premature.","[TITLE] obesity, equity and choice [KEYWORDS] distributive justice paternalism political philosophy public health ethics [ABSTRACT] obesity is often considered a public health crisis in rich countries that might be alleviated by preventive regulations such as a sugar tax or limiting the density of fast food outlets. this paper evaluates these regulations from the point of view of equity. obesity is in many countries correlated with socioeconomic status and some believe that preventive regulations would reduce inequity. the puzzle is this: how could policies that reduce the options of the badly off be more equitable? suppose we distinguish: (1) the badly off have poor options from (2) the badly off are poor at choosing between their options (ie, have a choosing problem). if obesity is due to a poverty of options, it would be perverse to reduce them further. some people in public health say that preventive regulations do not reduce options but, i shall argue, they are largely wrong. so the equity case for regulations depends on the worst off having a choosing problem. it also depends on their having a choosing problem that makes their choices against their interests. perhaps they do. i ask, briefly, what the evidence has to say about whether the badly off choose against their interests. the evidence is thin but implies that introducing preventive regulations for the sake of equity would be at least premature."

This paper examines the instruments used to enact these policy shifts. The consequences are explored in terms of the social exclusion and destitution created by disqualifying most asylum seekers from access to local authority housing, by disentitlement to housing and welfare benefits and by fragmenting service delivery. The pragmatic restructuring of housing provision is then examined. The role of housing associations, who are increasingly significant providers for this client group, is reviewed. Financial and legal constraints to action have resulted in pragmatic responses, a generally poor quality of service provision, inadequate access procedures, lack of co-ordination and networking, and limited institutional capacity.

For this purpose, required data are collected from eggplant, garlic, tea, hazelnut, kiwifruit and tangerine producers through questionnaires. In this study, GHG emissions are investigated under both On-Farm and Off-Farm sectors. Data envelopment analysis method is employed for the optimization of GHG emissions and energy flow. The highest and lowest energy consumption are related to tea and kiwifruit production, respectively. Results show that kiwifruit and eggplant have the highest scores in technical efficiency whilst tangerine and tea have the highest values in pure technical efficiency. The largest amount of energy is saved in kiwifruit orchards with 8316.29 MJ ha−1. Nitrogen fertilizer and diesel fuel have the topmost energy saving potential in most crops. Kiwifruit orchards have the highest potential for mitigation of GHG gas emissions (520.79 kg CO2 eq. ha−1). Results show that an appropriate usage of nitrogen fertilizer and replacement by organic fertilizer will mitigate GHG emissions as well as energy consumption. It can be concluded that GHG emissions can be mitigated by energy optimization in all the studied crops.","[TITLE] energy optimization and greenhouse gas emissions mitigation for agricultural and horticultural systems in northern iran [KEYWORDS] crop data envelopment analysis energy greenhouse gas emission optimization [ABSTRACT] the objective of this study is to comprehensively optimize energy usage and determine mitigation of greenhouse gas (ghg) emissions in agricultural and horticultural crops of guilan province, iran. for this purpose, required data are collected from eggplant, garlic, tea, hazelnut, kiwifruit and tangerine producers through questionnaires. in this study, ghg emissions are investigated under both on-farm and off-farm sectors. data envelopment analysis method is employed for the optimization of ghg emissions and energy flow. the highest and lowest energy consumption are related to tea and kiwifruit production, respectively. results show that kiwifruit and eggplant have the highest scores in technical efficiency whilst tangerine and tea have the highest values in pure technical efficiency. the largest amount of energy is saved in kiwifruit orchards with 8316.29 mj ha−1. nitrogen fertilizer and diesel fuel have the topmost energy saving potential in most crops. kiwifruit orchards have the highest potential for mitigation of ghg gas emissions (520.79 kg co2 eq. ha−1). results show that an appropriate usage of nitrogen fertilizer and replacement by organic fertilizer will mitigate ghg emissions as well as energy consumption. it can be concluded that ghg emissions can be mitigated by energy optimization in all the studied crops."
84905510863,12,Effect of cyclic loading on the tensile properties of ramie/PP composites,Cyclic loading Green composites Polypropylene Ramie Strength,"Nowadays, in the process of building a sustainable society, use of thermosetting resins derived from fossil resources raises an environmental impact problem in the field of composite materials, because of difficulty in recycle. The thermosetting resin is often used as a matrix of artificial fibers, such as glass and carbon, and generally used as GFRP and CFRP. These materials have superior mechanical properties, while their disposal is difficult. Thus, a natural resource material, called a ""green composite"" attracts considerable attention. Green composites are a material which consists of biodegradable or thermoplastic resin, and natural fibers. On the other hand, the composites are inferior to strength and stiffness in comparison with GFRP and CFRP, and therefore limited in only practical use to secondary structural members. The purpose of this study is thus to develop a green composite with high strength and stiffness through cyclic load application. The reinforcement and matrix used here are respectively ramie fibers and polypropylene (PP), and the composite specimens were fabricated through injection molding process. And, the composite specimens were treated through cyclic loading. After cyclic loading, while neat PP specimens were lowered in strength and stiffness, the composite specimens increased in strength and stiffness, because cellulose microfibrils in ramie fiber are reoriented along the loading direction. It is considered that such cyclic mechanical treatment is effective for improvement in mechanical properties of every green composite reinforced with plant-based natural fibers.","[TITLE] effect of cyclic loading on the tensile properties of ramie/pp composites [KEYWORDS] cyclic loading green composites polypropylene ramie strength [ABSTRACT] nowadays, in the process of building a sustainable society, use of thermosetting resins derived from fossil resources raises an environmental impact problem in the field of composite materials, because of difficulty in recycle. the thermosetting resin is often used as a matrix of artificial fibers, such as glass and carbon, and generally used as gfrp and cfrp. these materials have superior mechanical properties, while their disposal is difficult. thus, a natural resource material, called a ""green composite"" attracts considerable attention. green composites are a material which consists of biodegradable or thermoplastic resin, and natural fibers. on the other hand, the composites are inferior to strength and stiffness in comparison with gfrp and cfrp, and therefore limited in only practical use to secondary structural members. the purpose of this study is thus to develop a green composite with high strength and stiffness through cyclic load application. the reinforcement and matrix used here are respectively ramie fibers and polypropylene (pp), and the composite specimens were fabricated through injection molding process. and, the composite specimens were treated through cyclic loading. after cyclic loading, while neat pp specimens were lowered in strength and stiffness, the composite specimens increased in strength and stiffness, because cellulose microfibrils in ramie fiber are reoriented along the loading direction. it is considered that such cyclic mechanical treatment is effective for improvement in mechanical properties of every green composite reinforced with plant-based natural fibers."

Unfortunately, the RPL storing mode has been found restricted by storage limitations in the routers along the downward path. In fact, unreachable destinations problem may be easily encountered when a router fails, due to lack of memory, to store a routing entry for a target in its associated sub-network. In addition, the under-specification of Downward Advertisement Objects (DAOs) represents another serious issue in RPL. The timing of when and how often DAOs should be emitted is not fully addressed which may lead to inefficient implementations. Motivated by these observations, this paper presents an enhanced version of RPL called Enhanced-RPL. In the proposed enhancement, to mitigate the problem of storage limitation of the node's preferred parent, a node is allowed to distribute prefixes belonging to its sub-network among multiple parents. In addition, a more cautious approach for emitting DAOs is proposed to mitigate the issue of DAOs under-specification mechanisms. Our simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed Enhanced-RPL outperforms the RPL standard by an average of up to 64% in terms of control-plane overhead and 30% regarding the packet delivery ratio.","[TITLE] a new enhanced rpl based routing for internet of things [KEYWORDS] internet of things low-power and lossy networks rpl standard [ABSTRACT] the ipv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (rpl) has been recently standardized for routing in the constrained internet of things networks. unfortunately, the rpl storing mode has been found restricted by storage limitations in the routers along the downward path. in fact, unreachable destinations problem may be easily encountered when a router fails, due to lack of memory, to store a routing entry for a target in its associated sub-network. in addition, the under-specification of downward advertisement objects (daos) represents another serious issue in rpl. the timing of when and how often daos should be emitted is not fully addressed which may lead to inefficient implementations. motivated by these observations, this paper presents an enhanced version of rpl called enhanced-rpl. in the proposed enhancement, to mitigate the problem of storage limitation of the node's preferred parent, a node is allowed to distribute prefixes belonging to its sub-network among multiple parents. in addition, a more cautious approach for emitting daos is proposed to mitigate the issue of daos under-specification mechanisms. our simulation experiments demonstrate that the proposed enhanced-rpl outperforms the rpl standard by an average of up to 64% in terms of control-plane overhead and 30% regarding the packet delivery ratio."

However, the optimum solution might not perform beneficially in the real world as the simulation result indicated because a reservoir model generally contains considerable geological uncertainty due to limited information of deep underground. Optimizing objective function integrating the response values from different models can be considered as an approach to this difficulty. In the previous study, such objective functions were proposed. However, their applicability has not been evaluated deeply. Therefore, their applicability was examined through well placement optimization for Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage (CCS) under geological statistical uncertainty as a case study. In the case study, we considered an optimization of the multiple wells for CO2 injection in a heterogeneous reservoir whose geological uncertainty was represented by 50 statistically independent reservoir models. As a result, the optimum solution with using all models showed the high applicability by comparing with the sensitivity analysis of nominal solutions, which is independently optimized for the single model, against the uncertainty. In addition, one of the proposed objective functions showed the superior result.","[TITLE] well placement optimization under geological statistical uncertainty [KEYWORDS] cma-es carbon dioxide capture and storage geological statistical uncertainty robust optimization well placement optimization [ABSTRACT] to control fluid flow in underground geologic formations, the placement of injection/production wells needs to be optimized taking geological characteristics of the reservoir into account. however, the optimum solution might not perform beneficially in the real world as the simulation result indicated because a reservoir model generally contains considerable geological uncertainty due to limited information of deep underground. optimizing objective function integrating the response values from different models can be considered as an approach to this difficulty. in the previous study, such objective functions were proposed. however, their applicability has not been evaluated deeply. therefore, their applicability was examined through well placement optimization for carbon dioxide capture and storage (ccs) under geological statistical uncertainty as a case study. in the case study, we considered an optimization of the multiple wells for co2 injection in a heterogeneous reservoir whose geological uncertainty was represented by 50 statistically independent reservoir models. as a result, the optimum solution with using all models showed the high applicability by comparing with the sensitivity analysis of nominal solutions, which is independently optimized for the single model, against the uncertainty. in addition, one of the proposed objective functions showed the superior result."

Theoretically, intra-firm trade can be explained by the existence of economies of common governance and are often found to be associated with R&D-intensive industries and economies of scale. In empirical studies, intra-firm trade is often found to consist of intermediate inputs goods, resulting in vertically integrated production chains. The study is based on detailed firm-level data from around 300 foreign majority-owned affiliates (MOFAs) in manufacturing, in Sweden in 1993. The results show that intra-firm sales by MOFAs in Sweden are as high as those found in studies of manufacturing affiliates of US TNCs. Almost all of MOFAs' intra-firm exports are finished products, while intra-firm imports consist of material inputs and finished products for resale. This suggests that these MOFAs are only marginal involved in vertically integrated production chains, especially in terms of exports. The results of a regression analysis complement earlier studies by showing that the level and composition of intra-firm trade is significantly affected by the international strategy applied by TNCs when operating foreign manufacturing affiliates. Intra-firm exports of finished products and material inputs are positively associated with efficiency-seeking FDI, e.g. affiliates engaged in rationalised production. Market-seeking FDI is associated with intra-firm imports of complementary finished products for resale. By contrast, resource-seeking and strategic asset-seeking FDI was negatively associated with intra-firm trade.","[TITLE] tnc strategies and variations in intra-firm trade: the case of foreign manufacturing affiliates in sweden [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] the aim of this paper is to contribute to the understanding of the forms and determinants of intra-firm trade, i.e. international trade between different units under common tnc ownership, this being a major indication of ""deep economic integration"" between developed countries in the 1990s. theoretically, intra-firm trade can be explained by the existence of economies of common governance and are often found to be associated with r&d-intensive industries and economies of scale. in empirical studies, intra-firm trade is often found to consist of intermediate inputs goods, resulting in vertically integrated production chains. the study is based on detailed firm-level data from around 300 foreign majority-owned affiliates (mofas) in manufacturing, in sweden in 1993. the results show that intra-firm sales by mofas in sweden are as high as those found in studies of manufacturing affiliates of us tncs. almost all of mofas' intra-firm exports are finished products, while intra-firm imports consist of material inputs and finished products for resale. this suggests that these mofas are only marginal involved in vertically integrated production chains, especially in terms of exports. the results of a regression analysis complement earlier studies by showing that the level and composition of intra-firm trade is significantly affected by the international strategy applied by tncs when operating foreign manufacturing affiliates. intra-firm exports of finished products and material inputs are positively associated with efficiency-seeking fdi, e.g. affiliates engaged in rationalised production. market-seeking fdi is associated with intra-firm imports of complementary finished products for resale. by contrast, resource-seeking and strategic asset-seeking fdi was negatively associated with intra-firm trade."

In this alternative approach, different experts, risk-bearers, and local communities are involved and knowledge and practice is contested, co-produced and reflected upon.

This paper explores how use of the Internet during adolescence/late childhood and the degree of change while transitioning from late childhood to adulthood is related to sustainable travel patterns in young adults. We are particularly interested in the mediating role that attitudes towards the environment have on the relationship between early age Internet use and sustainable travel in young adults. The use of rich, longitudinal datasets, the 2004 British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) and the Understanding Society Survey (Wave 4, 2012/14), allow an investigation of these attitudes and relationships for the same people from childhood to adulthood. We use structural equation modeling (SEM) to examine the complex interrelationships between young adults’ Internet use over time, their travel modes and attitudes towards the environment, and other related behaviors. Our key finding is that consistently high levels of Internet use between adolescence and young adulthood is associated with the formation of environmental attitudes.

Objective: Using the conceptual framework for child malnutrition by the United Nations Children's Fund, we examined the predictors of underweight in children under five years in Ghana. Methods: This cross-sectional study made use of data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey. A total of 2720 children were included in the analysis. Descriptive and inferential statistics comprising frequency, percentage, chi-square, and binary logistic regression were used in analysing the data. Results: The prevalence of underweight was 11%. Age, wealth status, mother's education, region, ethnicity, household toilet facility, the source of drinking water, the incidence of diarrhoea, and subscription to health insurance significantly predicted underweight in the children. The risk of being underweight was higher in females than males (OR=1.04, 95% CI=0.81-1.34). This was, however, not statistically significant. The probability of being underweight also declined significantly with mother's level of education.

However, so far, the application of ethanol in energy has been impeded, due to the slow kinetics and low selectivity of ethanol oxidation and synthesis. Recently, Rh-based catalysts have been found to display a unique efficiency and selectivity in catalyzing both processes. However, to the best of our knowledge, the mechanisms are still unclear due to the intrinsic complexity of catalytic reactions on the Rh-based catalysts.

One of the problems lies in the focusing on the seedling vegetative stage, despite the fact that tolerance at the reproductive stages is different. This article highlights a new strategy for such research. The first phase of this study focused on finding closely-related genotypes that differed in a key trait related to salt tolerance. Four hundred lines of four species were subjected to 150 mM NaCl in sand culture. Four Aegilops kotchyi lines were selected in this phase. Two tolerant lines (Ak3390 and Ak3393) showed salinity tolerance to 150 mM NaCl both in the vegetative and the reproductive phase. The other two sensitive lines (Ak3511 and Ak4533) reached flowering but failed to produce viable seeds under salt. The four lines were compared during the second phase of the study in terms of ion accumulation and other processes leading to grain production. All lines exhibited decreasing ion content along the spike with no Na+ reaching the stigma. No significant difference was found between the tolerant and sensitive lines in pollen production and fertilization processes. The sensitive lines did not fill the seed endosperm under salt, and the seeds produced by the salt-treated plants were not viable; while the tolerant lines produced viable seeds with solid full endosperm. It is suggested that future studies will use this two-phase selection strategy in order to identify those genotypes that could be used for the study of key processes related to salt tolerance.","[TITLE] searching for salt tolerance among wild relatives of wheat: what should we look for?

A hybrid analytic numerical model of a simple geometry isothermal fuel cell is presented and comparatively evaluated by benchmarking it against a professional full 3D CFD simulation tool. This evaluation shows very close agreement with the benchmarking 3D CFD simulation and computational times comparable to 1D models.

This paper gives a general overview on the diversity of NTFPs in the Naban River Watershed National Nature Reserve, with a focus on medicinal and food plants. Data on NTFPs use were gathered through an ethnobotanical inventory with semistructured, free-listing, and household socioeconomic interviews. Interviews were supplemented with voucher collections. Bamboo shoots were analyzed further as proxy NTPF. It was hypothesized that there is no significant difference between collection amounts of bamboo shoots and their contribution to the household income between the villages studied. A rapid vulnerability assessment (RVA) was conducted to identify vulnerable and threatened species. A total of 480 plant species (25% of recorded flora) from 117 families and 334 genera are used as NTFPs by the local people. Results revealed that there is a significant difference in the collection and contribution of bamboo shoots to household income among the villages. However, their contribution to per-capita income is very low, and they are mainly used in households. Vulnerability assessment showed that most of the medicinal species have moderate vulnerable status and that most of the food species have less vulnerable status.

Nano membranes of 200nm, 100nm and 30nm were used to filtrate oil samples injected with different mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 gas. The distribution of asphaltene aggregates' size at different injected CO2 and CH4 concentrations were obtained and compared with the pore size distribution data of shale cores measured by mercury intrusion porosimeters. Results showed that a higher injected CO2 and CH4 concentration caused more asphaltene precipitation and growth in asphaltene aggregates' size.

Soil is one of the most diverse habitats on Earth and contains one of the most diverse assemblages of living organisms; however, the opacity of this world has severely limited our understanding of their functional contributions to soil processes and to ecosystem resilience. Traditional taxonomy, based on morphological and anatomical aspects, is becoming replaced by rapid processing molecular techniques (e.g., with marker gene-based approaches). However, this may be impracticable in many ecological studies and consequently, the majority of the current knowledge, still contributes little to our understanding of their role in ecosystem functioning. Over the years, different workers have produced several ""functional classifications"" based on the body width, feeding regime, certain behavioral and reproductive aspects and ecological niches of soil organisms. Unfortunately, the information available is severely restricted to ""major"" groups. A better physiological and metabolic understanding of when and how a complex community of soil organisms access nutrients, alter their environment and in turn, affect soil processes, will allow a more realistic quantitative evaluation of their ecological roles in the biogeochemical cycles.

Specifically, preference information based on engineering judgement and theoretical analysis is incorporated in the optimization procedure. The posteriori evolutionary multiobjective optimization (EMO) algorithm (nonpreference) and the preference-based interactive EMO algorithm are both applied to the seismic design of an reinforced concrete (RC) pier with two, three, and four objectives, namely, flexural strength coefficient, shear strength coefficient, reliability index of drift, and life-cycle cost coefficient. In terms of a rational displacement ductility, the safety preference information is applied to establish a value function after every few optimization runs, progressively directing the search of the EMO algorithm to more preferred solutions. By comparing the results of both algorithms, it is found that when there are more than three objectives, it is difficult for the nonpreference optimization to converge with the global Pareto frontier, resulting in a local optimal solution as the final design. The combination of preference structure and multiobjective optimization effectively avoids the challenges of global search and purposefully converges with the most preferred design.","[TITLE] interactive multiobjective optimization for life-cycle analysis in seismic design of bridges [KEYWORDS] bridge life-cycle seismic design multiobjective optimization preference information value function [ABSTRACT] to estimate life-cycle cost and future seismic capacity, the life-cycle analysis in seismic design of bridges is formulated as an interactive multiobjective decision-making and optimization problem. specifically, preference information based on engineering judgement and theoretical analysis is incorporated in the optimization procedure. the posteriori evolutionary multiobjective optimization (emo) algorithm (nonpreference) and the preference-based interactive emo algorithm are both applied to the seismic design of an reinforced concrete (rc) pier with two, three, and four objectives, namely, flexural strength coefficient, shear strength coefficient, reliability index of drift, and life-cycle cost coefficient. in terms of a rational displacement ductility, the safety preference information is applied to establish a value function after every few optimization runs, progressively directing the search of the emo algorithm to more preferred solutions. by comparing the results of both algorithms, it is found that when there are more than three objectives, it is difficult for the nonpreference optimization to converge with the global pareto frontier, resulting in a local optimal solution as the final design. the combination of preference structure and multiobjective optimization effectively avoids the challenges of global search and purposefully converges with the most preferred design."

30105172,8,Remote sensing and geographic information systems: Advanced technologies for environmental monitoring and management,Environmental management Environmental monitoring GIS Integration strategies Remote sensing Sustainable development,"We are modifying our environment at unprecedented rates and scales. We can, however, debate the specific spatial dimensions, rates and significance of these changes. Throughout history, technology has always been a key factor facilitating change. Technology in use today can create environmental change on spatial and temporal scales never before possible. Yet, it also offers us the ability to facilitate our investigations and leads to a more complete understanding of human impact on our environment. Through appropriate use of technologies we can move a significant way toward an environmentally sound management of the Earth's natural resources. Planning and development can no longer take these natural resources for granted. We have to consider not only the needs of the current generations but also those of future generations. The concept of sustainable development, originally set forth in the World Conservation Strategy (1980) and popularized by the Brundtland Commission in 1987 has been defined as ""development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet them"" (Estes et al. 1992). This statement, however, is still a declaration of intent and has to be specified and tested as to the degree to which it can be made operational within given regions of the globe for specific resources of concerns. Further compounding the issue is the growing necessity of examining such local, regional or national problems in the context of global climatic change scenarios. To carry out this concept of resource development with due consideration of the mid-term and the long-term effects of such development on the environment will require that researcher, planners and decisionmakers have access to unprecedented quantities and types of resource and environmental information. Today, a whole new suite of technologies that can facilitate the acquisition of data and the integration of these data into resources management decision processes are emerging. Use of these technologies for data collection, manipulation, analysis and information extraction can improve our understanding of the global environment and through site characterization of specific study areas, measure, map, monitor and model changes in that environment, and provide decision-makers with the information they require for environmentally sound planning and development. Significant among these technologies are remote sensing and geographic information systems (GIS). Remote sensing devices on aircraft and satellites are capable of recording environmental information at staggering rates with significant economies of scale for many purposes. Geographic information systems (GIS) can integrate these data with other spatial data (for example, maps) and non-spatial date (for example, tables or text) to facilitate new forms of analyses. It has to be noted, however, that these technologies are crossing the boundaries of many traditional disciplines, and the development of academic programs in remote sensing and GIS for environmental monitoring and management poses a challenge to established programs. This paper addresses the potential of remote sensing and GIS technologies for environmental monitoring and management. It reports on the efforts at the University of Vechta to establish a new University program in environmental monitoring and management. This program is placed in an interdisciplinary environment and integrates advanced spatial technologies such as remote sensing and GIS with ecological science and environmental planning.

Current selection of genotypes requires molecular characterization of available populations. Peanut genome database has several EST cDNAs which can be used to analyze gene expression. Analysis of proteins is a direct approach to define function of their associated genes. Proteome analysis linked to genome sequence information is critical for functional genomics. However, the available protein expression data is extremely inadequate. Proteome analysis of peanut leaf was conducted using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis in combination with sequence identification using MALDI/TOF to determine their identity and function related to growth, development and responses to stresses. Peanut leaf proteins were resolved into 300 polypeptides with pI values between 3.5 and 8.0 and relative molecular masses from 12 to 100 kDa. A master leaf polypeptide profile was generated based on the consistently expressed protein pattern. Proteins present in 205 spots were identified using GPS software and Viridiplantae database (NCBI). Identity of some of these proteins included RuBisCO, glutamine synthetase, glyoxisomal malate dehydrogenase, oxygen evolving enhancer protein and tubulin. Bioinformatical analyses showed that there are 133 unique protein identities. They were categorized into 10 and 8 groups according to their cellular compartmentalization and biological functionality, respectively.

The causative agent for this disease is the Shigella species. This organism is one of the third most common enteropathogens responsible for childhood diarrhea. Since Shigella can survive gastric acidity and is an intracellular pathogen, it becomes difficult to treat. Also, uncontrolled use of antibiotics has led to development of resistant strains which poses a threat to public health. Therefore, there is a need for long term control of Shigella infection which can be achieved by designing a proper and effective vaccine. In this study, emphasis was made on designing a candidate that could elicit both B-cell and T-cell immune response. Hence B- and T-cell epitopes of outer membrane channel protein (OM) and putative lipoprotein (PL) from S. flexneri 2a were computationally predicted using immunoinformatics approach and a chimeric construct (chimeric-OP) containing the immunogenic epitopes selected from OM and PL was designed, cloned and expressed in E. coli system. The immunogenicity of the recombinant chimeric-OP was assessed using Shigella antigen infected rabbit antibody. The result showed that the chimeric-OP was a synthetic peptide candidate suitable for the development of vaccine and immunodiagnostics against Shigella infection.","[TITLE] designing and evaluation of an antibody-targeted chimeric recombinant vaccine encoding shigella flexneri outer membrane antigens [KEYWORDS] antigens chimeric immunoinformatics outer membrane protein (omp) shigella flexneri vaccine [ABSTRACT] shigellosis is one of the most common diseases found in the developing countries, especially those countries that are prone flood. the causative agent for this disease is the shigella species. this organism is one of the third most common enteropathogens responsible for childhood diarrhea. since shigella can survive gastric acidity and is an intracellular pathogen, it becomes difficult to treat. also, uncontrolled use of antibiotics has led to development of resistant strains which poses a threat to public health. therefore, there is a need for long term control of shigella infection which can be achieved by designing a proper and effective vaccine. in this study, emphasis was made on designing a candidate that could elicit both b-cell and t-cell immune response. hence b- and t-cell epitopes of outer membrane channel protein (om) and putative lipoprotein (pl) from s. flexneri 2a were computationally predicted using immunoinformatics approach and a chimeric construct (chimeric-op) containing the immunogenic epitopes selected from om and pl was designed, cloned and expressed in e. coli system. the immunogenicity of the recombinant chimeric-op was assessed using shigella antigen infected rabbit antibody. the result showed that the chimeric-op was a synthetic peptide candidate suitable for the development of vaccine and immunodiagnostics against shigella infection."

Range-shifting species are predicted to encounter and respond to new selective regimes during their expansion phase, but also carry historical adaptations to their ancestral range. We sought to identify how historical and novel components of the environment interact to shape latitudinal trends in thermal tolerance, thermal tolerance breadth and phenotypic plasticity of a range-shifting species. Location: Southern and central Sweden. Methods: To evaluate phenotypic responses to changes in the thermal selective environment, we experimentally determined the upper and lower thermal tolerances of > 2000 wild-caught damselflies (Ischnura elegans) from populations distributed across core and expanding range-edge regions. We then identified changing correlations between thermal tolerance, climate and recent weather events across the range expansion. Niche modelling was employed to evaluate the relative contributions of varying climatic selective regimes to overall habitat suitability for the species in core versus range-edge regions. Results: Upper thermal tolerance exhibited local adaptation to climate in the core region, but showed evidence of having been released from thermal selection during the current range expansion. In contrast, chill coma recovery exhibited local adaptation across the core region and range expansion, corresponding to increased climatic variability at higher latitudes. Adaptive plasticity of lower thermal tolerances (acclimation ability) increased towards the northern, expanding range edge. Main conclusions: Our results suggest micro-evolutionary mechanisms for several large-scale and general biogeographical patterns, including spatially and latitudinally invariant heat tolerances (Brett's rule) and increased thermal acclimation rates and niche breadths at higher latitudes. Population-level processes unique to climate-mediated range expansions may commonly underpin many broader, macro-physiological trends.","[TITLE] latitudinal shift in thermal niche breadth results from thermal release during a climate-mediated range expansion [KEYWORDS]  maxent character release colonization and range shifts habitat suitability insect invasions ischnura elegans macroecology species distribution model sweden thermotolerance [ABSTRACT] aim: climate change is currently altering the geographical distribution of species, but how this process contributes to biogeographical variation in ecological traits is unknown. range-shifting species are predicted to encounter and respond to new selective regimes during their expansion phase, but also carry historical adaptations to their ancestral range. we sought to identify how historical and novel components of the environment interact to shape latitudinal trends in thermal tolerance, thermal tolerance breadth and phenotypic plasticity of a range-shifting species. location: southern and central sweden. methods: to evaluate phenotypic responses to changes in the thermal selective environment, we experimentally determined the upper and lower thermal tolerances of > 2000 wild-caught damselflies (ischnura elegans) from populations distributed across core and expanding range-edge regions. we then identified changing correlations between thermal tolerance, climate and recent weather events across the range expansion. niche modelling was employed to evaluate the relative contributions of varying climatic selective regimes to overall habitat suitability for the species in core versus range-edge regions. results: upper thermal tolerance exhibited local adaptation to climate in the core region, but showed evidence of having been released from thermal selection during the current range expansion. in contrast, chill coma recovery exhibited local adaptation across the core region and range expansion, corresponding to increased climatic variability at higher latitudes. adaptive plasticity of lower thermal tolerances (acclimation ability) increased towards the northern, expanding range edge. main conclusions: our results suggest micro-evolutionary mechanisms for several large-scale and general biogeographical patterns, including spatially and latitudinally invariant heat tolerances (brett's rule) and increased thermal acclimation rates and niche breadths at higher latitudes. population-level processes unique to climate-mediated range expansions may commonly underpin many broader, macro-physiological trends."

85015083727,13,Non-Stationary Rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency Relationship: a Comparison between Annual Maximum and Partial Duration Series,Climate change Extreme rainfall IDF relationship Non-linear trend Non-stationary,"The rainfall Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) relationship is the primary input for storm water management and other engineering design applications across the world and it is developed by fitting an appropriate theoretical probability distribution to annual maximum (AM) series or partial duration series (PDS) of rainfall. The existing IDF relationship developing methods consider the extreme rainfall series as a stationary series. There exist few studies that compared AM and PDS datasets for developing rainfall IDF relationship in a stationary condition. However, during the last few decades, the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events are increasing due to global climate change and creating a non-stationary component in the extreme rainfall series. Therefore, the rainfall IDF relationship developed with the stationary assumption is no longer tenable in a changing climate. Hence, it is inevitable to develop non-stationary rainfall IDF relationship and to understand the differences in non-stationary rainfall IDF relationships derived using AM and PDS datasets. Consequently, the objectives of this study are: (1) to develop non-stationary rainfall IDF relationships using both AM and PDS datasets; (2) to compare them in terms of return level estimation. In particular, the non-linear trend in different durations’ PDS and AM datasets of Hyderabad city (India) rainfall is modeled using Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MGA) generated Time based covariate. In this study, the PDS datasets are modeled by the Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD) while the AM datasets are modeled by the Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEVD). The time-varying component is introduced in the scale parameter of the GPD and the location parameter of the GEVD by linking the MGA generated covariate. In addition, the complexity of each non-stationary model is identified using the corrected Akaike Information Criteria (AICc) and the statistical significance of trend parameter in the non-stationary models is estimated using the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test. Upon detecting significant superiority of non-stationary models, the return levels of extreme rainfall event for 2-, 5-, 10- and 25-year return periods are calculated using non-stationary models. From the results, it is observed that the non-stationary return levels estimated with PDS datasets are higher than those estimated with AM datasets for short durations and smaller return periods while the non-stationary return levels estimated with AM datasets are higher than those estimated with PDS datasets for long durations and higher return periods.","[TITLE] non-stationary rainfall intensity-duration-frequency relationship: a comparison between annual maximum and partial duration series [KEYWORDS] climate change extreme rainfall idf relationship non-linear trend non-stationary [ABSTRACT] the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (idf) relationship is the primary input for storm water management and other engineering design applications across the world and it is developed by fitting an appropriate theoretical probability distribution to annual maximum (am) series or partial duration series (pds) of rainfall. the existing idf relationship developing methods consider the extreme rainfall series as a stationary series. there exist few studies that compared am and pds datasets for developing rainfall idf relationship in a stationary condition. however, during the last few decades, the intensity and frequency of extreme rainfall events are increasing due to global climate change and creating a non-stationary component in the extreme rainfall series. therefore, the rainfall idf relationship developed with the stationary assumption is no longer tenable in a changing climate. hence, it is inevitable to develop non-stationary rainfall idf relationship and to understand the differences in non-stationary rainfall idf relationships derived using am and pds datasets. consequently, the objectives of this study are: (1) to develop non-stationary rainfall idf relationships using both am and pds datasets; (2) to compare them in terms of return level estimation. in particular, the non-linear trend in different durations’ pds and am datasets of hyderabad city (india) rainfall is modeled using multi-objective genetic algorithm (mga) generated time based covariate. in this study, the pds datasets are modeled by the generalized pareto distribution (gpd) while the am datasets are modeled by the generalized extreme value distribution (gevd). the time-varying component is introduced in the scale parameter of the gpd and the location parameter of the gevd by linking the mga generated covariate. in addition, the complexity of each non-stationary model is identified using the corrected akaike information criteria (aicc) and the statistical significance of trend parameter in the non-stationary models is estimated using the likelihood ratio (lr) test. upon detecting significant superiority of non-stationary models, the return levels of extreme rainfall event for 2-, 5-, 10- and 25-year return periods are calculated using non-stationary models. from the results, it is observed that the non-stationary return levels estimated with pds datasets are higher than those estimated with am datasets for short durations and smaller return periods while the non-stationary return levels estimated with am datasets are higher than those estimated with pds datasets for long durations and higher return periods."

85059587397,13,Adaptation of soil microbial growth to temperature: Using a tropical elevation gradient to predict future changes, Q 10 Ratkowsky equation bacteria climate warming fungi soil carbon cycle tropical forest," Terrestrial biogeochemical feedbacks to the climate are strongly modulated by the temperature response of soil microorganisms. Tropical forests, in particular, exert a major influence on global climate because they are the most productive terrestrial ecosystem. We used an elevation gradient across tropical forest in the Andes (a gradient of 20°C mean annual temperature, MAT), to test whether soil bacterial and fungal community growth responses are adapted to long-term temperature differences. We evaluated the temperature dependency of soil bacterial and fungal growth using the leucine- and acetate-incorporation methods, respectively, and determined indices for the temperature response of growth: Q 10 (temperature sensitivity over a given 10oC range) and T min (the minimum temperature for growth). For both bacterial and fungal communities, increased MAT (decreased elevation) resulted in increases in Q 10 and T min of growth. Across a MAT range from 6°C to 26°C, the Q 10 and T min varied for bacterial growth (Q 10–20  = 2.4 to 3.5; T min  = −8°C to −1.5°C) and fungal growth (Q 10–20  = 2.6 to 3.6; T min  = −6°C to −1°C). Thus, bacteria and fungi did not differ significantly in their growth temperature responses with changes in MAT. Our findings indicate that across natural temperature gradients, each increase in MAT by 1°C results in increases in T min of microbial growth by approximately 0.3°C and Q 10–20 by 0.05, consistent with long-term temperature adaptation of soil microbial communities. A 2°C warming would increase microbial activity across a MAT gradient of 6°C to 26°C by 28% to 15%, respectively, and temperature adaptation of microbial communities would further increase activity by 1.2% to 0.3%. The impact of warming on microbial activity, and the related impact on soil carbon cycling, is thus greater in regions with lower MAT. These results can be used to predict future changes in the temperature response of microbial activity over different levels of warming and over large temperature ranges, extending to tropical regions.

Since RESs are normally coupled to electrical grids through grid-connected power converters, which do not possess any rotational inertia as conventional synchronous generators do, modern power systems will face frequency control challenges as the power system inertia continues to decrease. To address the lack of inertia concern, supercapacitor energy storage systems (SESSs) are implemented in this paper to generate virtual inertia by proportionally linking the grid frequency to the voltage references of supercapacitors. In this way, the improvements of inertia and frequency control can be achieved. More importantly, this paper discloses that the basic inertia control scheme introduces inertia emulation errors under large frequency disturbances. As a solution, this paper presents a nonlinear inertia control scheme, which ensures fair inertia emulation even under large frequency disturbances. Simulation and experimental results are finally presented to verify the effectiveness of the virtual inertia and the control schemes.","[TITLE] inertia emulation through supercapacitor energy storage systems [KEYWORDS] power converters renewable energy sources (ress) supercapacitor energy storage system (sess) virtual inertia [ABSTRACT] to establish a more reliable, sustainable and high-efficiency smart grid, renewable energy sources (ress) have been increasingly integrated into modern power systems. since ress are normally coupled to electrical grids through grid-connected power converters, which do not possess any rotational inertia as conventional synchronous generators do, modern power systems will face frequency control challenges as the power system inertia continues to decrease. to address the lack of inertia concern, supercapacitor energy storage systems (sesss) are implemented in this paper to generate virtual inertia by proportionally linking the grid frequency to the voltage references of supercapacitors. in this way, the improvements of inertia and frequency control can be achieved. more importantly, this paper discloses that the basic inertia control scheme introduces inertia emulation errors under large frequency disturbances. as a solution, this paper presents a nonlinear inertia control scheme, which ensures fair inertia emulation even under large frequency disturbances. simulation and experimental results are finally presented to verify the effectiveness of the virtual inertia and the control schemes."

The sensor is based on Tunable Diode Laser Absorption Spectroscopy (TDLAS) and incorporates four optical channels - two miniature White cells and two double-traversal cells - with base lengths of 6cm. It has been demonstrated at a hot air test stand and in the exhaust manifold of a single-cylinder research engine, with measured temperatures of up to 1000K. Stable operation was achieved with absorption lengths of up to 192cm (test stand) and 97cm (engine). Employing time-division multiplexed detection, six species were measured simultaneously in the engine exhaust, at wavelengths ranging from 1.4μm to 5.2 μm: water vapor (H 2 O), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), carbon monoxide (CO), methane (CH 4 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and nitric oxide (NO). The effective measurement rate was as high as 1kHz, and cycle-to-cycle variations were clearly detected. We show the correlation of the air-fuel equivalence ratio with the spectroscopically measured mole fraction of each species. At a cycle-resolved rate, detection limits for the legally regulated species NO and NO 2 were 1ppm and 4ppm, respectively.

85028296256,13,Tuning dry reforming of methane for F-T syntheses: A thermodynamic approach,Carbon elimination DRM Fischer-Tropch synthesis H2/CO ratio Thermodynamic analysis,"In this research, a thermodynamic equilibrium model was established using FactSage to study the way to tune H2/CO ratio of syngas produced via dry (CO2) reforming of methane (DRM) for various F-T syntheses aiming at eliminating the use of a water–gas-shift unit. The effects of operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure and CH4/CO2 mole ratio, on CH4 and CO2 conversion, H2 and CO yield, and solid carbon yield in DRM were investigated. These operating conditions were studied in a wide range, i.e., 550–1200 °C for temperature, 0.05–5 MPa for pressure and 0.5–2 for CH4/CO2 mole ratio. The results showed that lower CH4/CO2 ratios favoured high CH4 conversion and CO selectivity, but hampered CO2 conversion and H2 selectivity. However, the increase in pressure hindered CH4 conversion, CO2 conversion, H2 selectivity and CO selectivity except for carbon yield. Since the deactivation of catalyst associated with coke formation is the major obstacle for the industrialization of DRM process, a carbon-free regime of DRM was identified as CH4/CO2 mole ratio = 1 and pressure = 0.1 MPa and temperature >1000 °C. Although the H2/CO ratio could be adjusted by adjusting CH4/CO2 mole ratio and/or pressure to satisfy the requirements of different F-T processes, the adjustment of CH4/CO2 mole ratio was found to be a more efficient way of tuning H2/CO mole ratio than adjusting operating pressure. The dependence of H2/CO ratio in syngas on operating conditions of the DRM process was also revealed in this research. With the assistance of this relationship, optimal operating conditions for DRM could be quickly determined based on the required H2/CO mole ratio for various typical F-T processes. It is shown that when the operating temperature of DRM was raised to over 700 °C, the H2/CO ratio obtained at CH4/CO2 ≤ 1 and P = 0.1 MPa was preferable for the synthesis of olefins, heavy hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. Otherwise the syngas was more suitable for the production of alkanes (C1–C5).","[TITLE] tuning dry reforming of methane for f-t syntheses: a thermodynamic approach [KEYWORDS] carbon elimination drm fischer-tropch synthesis h2/co ratio thermodynamic analysis [ABSTRACT] in this research, a thermodynamic equilibrium model was established using factsage to study the way to tune h2/co ratio of syngas produced via dry (co2) reforming of methane (drm) for various f-t syntheses aiming at eliminating the use of a water–gas-shift unit. the effects of operating conditions, such as temperature, pressure and ch4/co2 mole ratio, on ch4 and co2 conversion, h2 and co yield, and solid carbon yield in drm were investigated. these operating conditions were studied in a wide range, i.e., 550–1200 °c for temperature, 0.05–5 mpa for pressure and 0.5–2 for ch4/co2 mole ratio. the results showed that lower ch4/co2 ratios favoured high ch4 conversion and co selectivity, but hampered co2 conversion and h2 selectivity. however, the increase in pressure hindered ch4 conversion, co2 conversion, h2 selectivity and co selectivity except for carbon yield. since the deactivation of catalyst associated with coke formation is the major obstacle for the industrialization of drm process, a carbon-free regime of drm was identified as ch4/co2 mole ratio = 1 and pressure = 0.1 mpa and temperature >1000 °c. although the h2/co ratio could be adjusted by adjusting ch4/co2 mole ratio and/or pressure to satisfy the requirements of different f-t processes, the adjustment of ch4/co2 mole ratio was found to be a more efficient way of tuning h2/co mole ratio than adjusting operating pressure. the dependence of h2/co ratio in syngas on operating conditions of the drm process was also revealed in this research. with the assistance of this relationship, optimal operating conditions for drm could be quickly determined based on the required h2/co mole ratio for various typical f-t processes. it is shown that when the operating temperature of drm was raised to over 700 °c, the h2/co ratio obtained at ch4/co2 ≤ 1 and p = 0.1 mpa was preferable for the synthesis of olefins, heavy hydrocarbons and oxygenated compounds. otherwise the syngas was more suitable for the production of alkanes (c1–c5)."

Employing a newly harmonized occupational classification, it provides new insights into the nature and evolution of occupational segregation and on the forces driving these changes over this period of time.

84980324626,13,Are climate restricted areas a viable interim climate mitigation option over the north atlantic?,missing,"In order to achieve global environmental goals like the 2-degree-target, as well as to reduce longer-term emission levels, mitigation measures have to be introduced, preferably as early as possible. In aviation, the implementation of the most promising mitigation strategies, e.g. climate optimized routing, is linked with several technical challenges. An early introduction of interim mitigation strategies, which bridges the time period until most auspicious approaches reach market maturity, may pave the way for a prompt reduction of aviation’s induced global warming. Within this study, climate restricted airspaces (CRA) are defined in analogy to military exclusion zones. Climate cost functions (CCF) characterize the environmental impact caused by an aircraft emission at a certain location and time. To estimate the monthly climate sensitivity of an area, CCFs are derived with the climate-response model AirClim. Within this study, we close regions with climate sensitivities greater than a threshold value for a period of time (e.g. a month) and affected flight trajectories are re-routed cost optimally around them. The evaluation of the climate impact mitigation potential of climate restricted areas is performed based on optimal control techniques. Monetary costs are integrated into the cost functional of the Trajectory Optimization Module (TOM). Further, high penalties are introduced within restricted airspaces in order to ensure the avoidance of CRA. The cost-benefit potential (climate impact mitigation vs. rise in operating costs) for this interim mitigation concept is investigated for varying threshold values for the closure of airspace and compared with climate optimized trajectories (COT) for different routes and seasons of the year.","[TITLE] are climate restricted areas a viable interim climate mitigation option over the north atlantic?

84955447795,12,Global nutrient transport in a world of giants,Anadromous fish Biogeochemical cycling Extinctions Megafauna Whales,"The past was a world of giants, with abundant whales in the sea and large animals roaming the land. However, that world came to an end followingmassive late-Quaternarymegafauna extinctions on land and widespread population reductions in greatwhale populations over the past few centuries. These losses are likely to have had important consequences for broad-scale nutrient cycling, because recent literature suggests that large animals disproportionately drive nutrient movement. We estimate that the capacity of animals to move nutrients away from concentration patches has decreased to about 8% of the preextinction value on land and about 5%of historic values in oceans. For phosphorus (P), a key nutrient, upward movement in the ocean by marine mammals is about 23% of its former capacity (previously about 340 million kg of P per year). Movements by seabirds and anadromous fish provide important transfer of nutrients from the sea to land, totalling ∼150 million kg of P per year globally in the past, a transfer that has declined to less than 4% of this value as a result of the decimation of seabird colonies and anadromous fish populations. We propose that in the past, marine mammals, seabirds, anadromous fish, and terrestrial animals likely formed an interlinked system recycling nutrients from the ocean depths to the continental interiors, with marine mammals moving nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters, seabirds and anadromous fish moving nutrients from the ocean to land, and large animals moving nutrients away from hotspots into the continental interior.","[TITLE] global nutrient transport in a world of giants [KEYWORDS] anadromous fish biogeochemical cycling extinctions megafauna whales [ABSTRACT] the past was a world of giants, with abundant whales in the sea and large animals roaming the land. however, that world came to an end followingmassive late-quaternarymegafauna extinctions on land and widespread population reductions in greatwhale populations over the past few centuries. these losses are likely to have had important consequences for broad-scale nutrient cycling, because recent literature suggests that large animals disproportionately drive nutrient movement. we estimate that the capacity of animals to move nutrients away from concentration patches has decreased to about 8% of the preextinction value on land and about 5%of historic values in oceans. for phosphorus (p), a key nutrient, upward movement in the ocean by marine mammals is about 23% of its former capacity (previously about 340 million kg of p per year). movements by seabirds and anadromous fish provide important transfer of nutrients from the sea to land, totalling ∼150 million kg of p per year globally in the past, a transfer that has declined to less than 4% of this value as a result of the decimation of seabird colonies and anadromous fish populations. we propose that in the past, marine mammals, seabirds, anadromous fish, and terrestrial animals likely formed an interlinked system recycling nutrients from the ocean depths to the continental interiors, with marine mammals moving nutrients from the deep sea to surface waters, seabirds and anadromous fish moving nutrients from the ocean to land, and large animals moving nutrients away from hotspots into the continental interior."

Mechanisms and distinctive features,De-politicization Effectiveness Individualization Neoliberalism Social investment Social policy Third sector,"Social policy has undergone a major process of de-politicization all over Europe in the last twenty years, that was fostered by the paradigm shift towards the so-called Social Investment Welfare State. Though similar processes are taking place in many policy areas, social policy can be considered one of the most promising fields of observation of de-politicization. The downgrading of the political character of decision making, indeed, is in sharp contrast with the relevance of the debate about values and justice and with the conflicts that accompanied the establishment of welfare systems. The paper argues that de-politicization is the result of the interaction between three different mechanisms: the shift of emphasis from justice to effectiveness and the model of ""governance by numbers""; the process of individualization of social intervention that marginalized collective responsibilities; the inclusive model of governance that coopt civil society organizations reducing their role as conflicting actors. The three mechanisms give way to a model of de-politicization distinguished by the narrowing of the political debate about solutions, models of intervention and principles, based on inclusion rather than delegation and in which political actors do not disappear. The process of de-politicization is relatively independent from the trend of retrenchment that begins with the political success of neoliberalism.

In our work, three dimensional (3D) flower-like ZnO hierarchical nanostructures assembled with numerous nanosheets were fabricated by a simple, template-free and one-step hydrothermal route. The products were characterized by XRD, UV-Vis, PL, SEM, TEM, HRTEM techniques. In the process, NH4F played a crucial role for the formation of ZnO hierarchical nanostructures, which was acted both as the alkali source and morphology director. Furthermore, the growth of ZnO involved a phase transformation from intermediate compound ZnF(OH) to ZnO. To further improve the photocatalytic activity, Ag-doped ZnO photocatalyst was also prepared. The photocatalytic results indicated that the Ag/ZnO exhibited higher photocatalytic activity than the pure ZnO. The great enhancement was mainly ascribed to their unique hierarchical nanostructures as well as the modification of Ag nanoparticles.

Partial nitritation was established by finely adjusting the airflow rate (AFR) and the influent loading rate (ILR) to an oxygen-limiting condition. The long-term operation of the batch reactor showed that more than 55% removal of the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and 60% elimination of total nitrogen (TN) were obtained. Cycle analysis showed that heterotrophic denitrification contributed to approximately 28% reduction of nitrogen and 24% reduction of COD in the bulk liquid. This study showed that the treatment capacity increased with the increasing total air flux (TAF), and that nitrate formation could be inhibited by controlling the ratio of TAF to ILR below 240 (m3 air m-3/kg COD). It was also determined that the effluent pH was an indicator of the partial nitritation performance.

84937571906,13,Air quality and climate connections,missing,"Multiple linkages connect air quality and climate change. Many air pollutant sources also emit carbon dioxide (CO2), the dominant anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG). The two main contributors to non-attainment of U.S. ambient air quality standards, ozone (O3) and particulate matter (PM), interact with radiation, forcing climate change. PM warms by absorbing sunlight (e.g., black carbon) or cools by scattering sunlight (e.g., sulfates) and interacts with clouds; these radiative and microphysical interactions can induce changes in precipitation and regional circulation patterns. Climate change is expected to degrade air quality in many polluted regions by changing air pollution meteorology (ventilation and dilution), precipitation and other removal processes, and by triggering some amplifying responses in atmospheric chemistry and in anthropogenic and natural sources. Together, these processes shape distributions and extreme episodes of O3 and PM. Global modeling indicates that as air pollution programs reduce SO2 to meet health and other air quality goals, near-term warming accelerates due to “unmasking” of warming induced by rising CO2. Air pollutant controls on CH4, a potent GHG and precursor to global O3 levels, and on sources with high black carbon (BC) to organic carbon (OC) ratios could offset near-term warming induced by SO2 emission reductions, while reducing global background O3 and regionally high levels of PM. Lowering peak warming requires decreasing atmospheric CO2, which for some source categories would also reduce co-emitted air pollutants or their precursors. Model projections for alternative climate and air quality scenarios indicate a wide range for U.S. surface O3 and fine PM, although regional projections may be confounded by interannual to decadal natural climate variability. Continued implementation of U.S. NOx emission controls guards against rising pollution levels triggered either by climate change or by global emission growth.

33750837230,13,Do changes in the midlatitude circulation have any impact on the Arctic surface air temperature trend?,missing,"The warming of the near-surface air in the Arctic region has been larger than the global mean surface warming. There is general agreement that the Arctic amplification of the surface air temperature (SAT) trend to a considerable extent is due to local effects such as the retreat of sea ice, especially during the summer months, and earlier melting of snow in the spring season. There is no doubt that these processes are important causes of the Arctic SAT trend. It is less clear, however, whether the trend may also be related to recent changes in the atmospheric midlatitude circulation. This question is the focus of the present paper. Model experiments have shown that in a warmer climate responding to, for example, a doubling of CO2, the atmospheric northward energy transport (ANET) will increase and cause polar SAT amplification. In the present study, the development of the ANET across 60°N and its linkage to the Arctic SAT have been explored using the ERA-40 reanalysis data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). It is found that during 1979-2001, the ANET has experienced an overall positive but weak trend, which was largest during the period from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s. In addition, it is found that the Arctic SAT is sensitive to variability of the ANET across 60°N and hence to variability of the midlatitude circulation: A large ANET is followed by warming of the Arctic where ANET leads by about 5 days. The warming is located primarily north of the Atlantic and Pacific sectors, indicating that baroclinic weather systems developing around the Icelandic and Aleutian lows are important for the energy transport. Furthermore, it is suggested here that a small, but statistically significant, part of the mean Arctic SAT trend is linked to the trend in the ANET. Another important indicator of the midlatitude circulation is the Arctic Oscillation (AO). Through the 1980s and early 1990s the AO index has shown a positive trend. However, even though a part of the SAT trend can be related to the AO in localized parts of the Arctic area, the mean Arctic SAT trend shows no significant linkage to the AO. © 2006 American Meteorological Society.","[TITLE] do changes in the midlatitude circulation have any impact on the arctic surface air temperature trend?

Two different scenarios are considered. The first scenario (scen.#1), starting with a homogeneous salinity of S = 20 PSU and without wind forcing, studies a stratification process under the influence of a periodic seawater inflow and a strong freshwater inflow from a hydropower plant (250 m3/s). Then, in the second scenario (scen.#2), we study how a strong wind of 80 km/h can destroy the haline stratification obtained at the end of scen.#1. The MARS3D numerical model is used to analyze the 3D current and salinity distribution induced by these three meteorological, oceanic and anthropogenic forcings in this lagoon and in the Caronte channel. The main goal is to determine the bottom shear stress (BSS) in the nearshore areas of Zostera noltei replanting, and to compare it with the threshold for erosion of the bottom sediments for different bottom roughness parameters. The most interesting results concern the four nearshore replanting areas; two are situated on the eastern side of EB and two on the western side. The results of scen.#2 show that all these areas are subject to a downwind coastal jet. The destratification process is very beneficial; salinity always remains greater than 12 PSU for a N-NW wind of 80 km/h and a hydropower runoff of 250 m3/s. Concerning BSS, it presents a maximum near the shoreline and decreases along transects perpendicular to the shoreline. There exists a zone, parallel to the shoreline, where BSS presents a minimum (where BSS = 0). When comparing the BSS value at the four control points with the critical value, BSScr, at which the sediment mobility would occur, we see that for the smaller bottom roughness values (ranging from z0 = 3.5 × 10−4 mm, to 3.5 × 10−2 mm) BSS largely surpasses this critical value. For a N-NW wind speed of 40 km/h (which is blowing for around 100 days per year), BSS still largely surpasses BSScr - at least for the silt sediments (ranging from z0 = 3.5 × 10−4 mm, to 3.5 × 10−3 mm).

The drought reconstruction, spanning 1788-1999 A.D., was developed by calibrating tree-ring data with the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), an index that describes the regional moisture condition properly. The reconstruction was verified with independent data, and accounts for 45.7% of the actual PDSI variance during their common period (1941-1999). The full reconstruction indicates that the regional drought variability was relatively stable during the nineteenth century, but became more variable and persistent during the twentieth century.

We develop an extended public goods game model, in which individuals distribute their contributions based on the groups' qualities. Namely, the individuals are allowed to increase their investment to the superior groups at the expense of the nasty ones. The quality of a group is positively correlated with its cooperation level. In numerical simulations, synchronized stochastic strategy updating rule based on pairwise comparison for a fixed noise level is adopted. The results show that the high-quality group preference mechanism can greatly improve cooperation, compared with conventional models. Besides, the system with stronger preference toward high-quality groups performs better.

79951883805,13,North American isoprene influence on intercontinental ozone pollution,missing,"Changing land-use and climate may alter emissions of biogenic isoprene, a key ozone (O3) precursor. Isoprene is also a precursor to peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) and thus affects partitioning among oxidized nitrogen (NOy) species, shifting the balance towards PAN, which more efficiently contributes to long-range transport relative to nitric acid (HNO3) which rapidly deposits. With a suite of sensitivity simulations in the MOZART-2 global tropospheric chemistry model, we gauge the relative importance of the intercontinental influence of a 20% increase in North American (NA) isoprene and a 20% decrease in NA anthropogenic emissions (nitrogen oxides (NOx), non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and NOx + NMVOC + carbon monoxide + aerosols). The surface O3 response to NA isoprene emissions (&Delta;O3-ISOP) in surface air over NA is about one third of the response to all NA anthropogenic emissions (&Delta;O 3-ANTH; although with different signs). Over intercontinental distances, &Delta;O3-ISOP is relatively larger; in summer and fall, &Delta;O3-ISOP in surface air over Europe and North Africa (EU region) is more than half of &Delta;O3-ANTH. Future increases in NA isoprene emissions could thus offset decreases in EU surface O 3 resulting from controls on NA anthropogenic emissions. Over the EU region, &Delta;PAN-ISOP at 700 hPa is roughly the same magnitude as &Delta;PAN-ANTH (oppositely signed). Outside of the continental source region, the percentage changes in PAN are at least twice as large as for surface O3, implying that long-term PAN measurements at high altitude sites may help to detect O3 precursor emission changes. We find that neither the baseline level of isoprene emissions nor the fate of isoprene nitrates contributes to the large diversity in model estimates of the anthropogenic emission influence on intercontinental surface O3 or oxidized nitrogen deposition reported in the recent TF HTAP multi-model studies (TFHTAP, 2007). © 2011 Author(s).","[TITLE] north american isoprene influence on intercontinental ozone pollution [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] changing land-use and climate may alter emissions of biogenic isoprene, a key ozone (o3) precursor. isoprene is also a precursor to peroxy acetyl nitrate (pan) and thus affects partitioning among oxidized nitrogen (noy) species, shifting the balance towards pan, which more efficiently contributes to long-range transport relative to nitric acid (hno3) which rapidly deposits. with a suite of sensitivity simulations in the mozart-2 global tropospheric chemistry model, we gauge the relative importance of the intercontinental influence of a 20% increase in north american (na) isoprene and a 20% decrease in na anthropogenic emissions (nitrogen oxides (nox), non-methane volatile organic compounds (nmvoc) and nox + nmvoc + carbon monoxide + aerosols). the surface o3 response to na isoprene emissions (&delta;o3-isop) in surface air over na is about one third of the response to all na anthropogenic emissions (&delta;o 3-anth; although with different signs). over intercontinental distances, &delta;o3-isop is relatively larger; in summer and fall, &delta;o3-isop in surface air over europe and north africa (eu region) is more than half of &delta;o3-anth. future increases in na isoprene emissions could thus offset decreases in eu surface o 3 resulting from controls on na anthropogenic emissions. over the eu region, &delta;pan-isop at 700 hpa is roughly the same magnitude as &delta;pan-anth (oppositely signed). outside of the continental source region, the percentage changes in pan are at least twice as large as for surface o3, implying that long-term pan measurements at high altitude sites may help to detect o3 precursor emission changes. we find that neither the baseline level of isoprene emissions nor the fate of isoprene nitrates contributes to the large diversity in model estimates of the anthropogenic emission influence on intercontinental surface o3 or oxidized nitrogen deposition reported in the recent tf htap multi-model studies (tfhtap, 2007). © 2011 author(s)."

Extractive industries have played a controversial role in sub-Saharan Africa due in particular to the prevalence of the resource curse. Nevertheless, energy exports will continue to play an important role in fuelling economic growth and, potentially, also development as new deposits of natural gas and oil are discovered across the region.

The urban hierarchy of regions is undergoing transformation, causing economic fortunes to vary markedly among different localities. In China, these global forces and regional restructuring have caused a relative economic decline in some historically powerful cities, and have also brought about the emergence of new economic centers. In response to these forces, many Chinese cities have been driven into adopting a series of new competitive strategies, which seek to win back and build up their leading positions and competitiveness. To translate these strategies into concrete actions, local governments have promoted high-profile and face-lifting projects and investments.

We examined the data of 125 Chinese Pharmaceuticals between 2010-2016 to investigate the impact of overall corporate social responsibility (CSR) performance as well as the performance on five unique aspects of CSR such as shareholders, employees, customers and suppliers, environmental practices, and the society to gauge the impact of these individual dimensions on the firm's financial performance. The Hexun rating system is used to gauge a firm's CSR performance on various stakeholder dimensions as it is one of the widely accepted CSR measurement criteria in China. The firm performance is measured by Tobin's Q, return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), and earnings per share (EPS) ratios. The outcome of the panel-based regression models reveals that the overall CSR score has a positive and significant influence on a firm's financial indicators. Moreover, although all the CSR dimensions relate positively to firm performance, the environmental aspect of CSR has the most profound impact on firm performance followed by customers and suppliers, and employees. However, the shareholders and social dimensions have a relatively lesser influence on firm performance.

In addition to a geometric path, Starcast can also discover a non-geometric path to a destination by exploiting the path history of location updates. Thus, the routing void can be minimised by alternating the two. Moreover, Starcast employs two location-based optimisations to further reduce the overhead of on-demand route discovery on inevitable voids. The detailed NS-2 simulations demonstrate that Starcast can not only increase network performance but also reduce energy consumption compared with the existing protocols based on on-demand route discovery or a plain geometric routing.","[TITLE] starcast: robust and energy-efficient geometric routing for mobile sensor networks [KEYWORDS] geometric routing manet mobility sensor networks [ABSTRACT] assuming global positioning system (gps)-enabled mobile sensor nodes we propose a new geometric routing protocol called starcast that is designed to efficiently support node mobility as well as location services for mobile sensor networks (msns). in addition to a geometric path, starcast can also discover a non-geometric path to a destination by exploiting the path history of location updates. thus, the routing void can be minimised by alternating the two. moreover, starcast employs two location-based optimisations to further reduce the overhead of on-demand route discovery on inevitable voids. the detailed ns-2 simulations demonstrate that starcast can not only increase network performance but also reduce energy consumption compared with the existing protocols based on on-demand route discovery or a plain geometric routing."

Important changes regarding the educational structure of employees have taken place during this period. The share of employed with tertiary education has significantly increased and the share of employed with basic vocational education substantially decreased. The relative returns to different types and levels of education were estimated using a standard Mincerian wage equation framework. The results indicate that recent changes in the structure of employment have important implications for wage structure. In particular, the entry of many young workers with tertiary education into the labour market has resulted in a decline in the relative level of wages they receive. On the other hand, a noticeable decrease in the number of vocational education graduates and deficits in the labour supply in some occupations have translated into an increase in relative wages for this type of workers.

84990051040,8,Farm water productivity in broiler production: case studies in Brazil,AgroHyd farmmodel Brazil Broiler production Water productivity,"The expected increase in broiler meat consumption in Brazil in future will lead to further increase in water use. The objective of this study was to quantify water productivity of four Brazilian broiler farms. Water use in the four farming systems was analyzed in terms of feed production, drinking, cleaning, and cooling. One focus was the crop water productivity of the respective corn and soy producing regions in Brazil. After the spatial and temporal boundaries of the farm system and the water flows were defined, the indicator farm water productivity was calculated to assess water use at the farm scale. The farm water productivity describes the ratio of farm output to water input, where the water input is the total of those water inflows into the farm system that can be assigned to the generation of farm output. Farm output is expressed on a mass basis, food energy basis, and monetary basis. The farm water productivity and the crop water productivity were calculated using the modeling software AgroHyd Farmmodel. In all fattening systems, water input for feed production accounted for 99.7% of the total water input. In the four systems, farm water productivity accounted for 0.29–0.33 kg carcass weight per m3 water input, 2.60–2.88 MJ food energy per m3 water input, and 0.15–0.17 R$ per m3 water input. The results showed that the highest water demand was for feed production.

This paper structures a spatial econometric model of the panel for the identification of spatial effect on provincial carbon intensity and energy intensity, in turn to discuss the mutual positive influences between the areas. According to the empirical study, there exists significant positive mutual influence and convergence between provincial carbon intensity and energy intensity. The provincial level of the indicators also converges to country’s average level in a picture of “boats rising with the tide”. Additionally, provincial indicators only respond selectively to the domestic economic growth and sometimes even show a passive manner.","[TITLE] the spatial effect identification of regional carbon intensity and energy consumption intensity of china [KEYWORDS] carbon intensity energy intensity reduce the energy consumption and pollution emission spatial econometric model of the panel spatial effect [ABSTRACT] it is important and practical to search for an effective way to reduce the energy consumption and pollution emission. this paper structures a spatial econometric model of the panel for the identification of spatial effect on provincial carbon intensity and energy intensity, in turn to discuss the mutual positive influences between the areas. according to the empirical study, there exists significant positive mutual influence and convergence between provincial carbon intensity and energy intensity. the provincial level of the indicators also converges to country’s average level in a picture of “boats rising with the tide”. additionally, provincial indicators only respond selectively to the domestic economic growth and sometimes even show a passive manner."
84876686165,7,Enhancement of fermentable sugar yields by α-xylosidase supplementation of commercial cellulases,Aspergillus niger Biofuel Cellulase Corn stover Lignocellulose Trichoderma reesei Xyloglucan,"Background: Although α-linked xylose is a major constituent of the hemicelluloses of land plants, few secreted α-xylosidases have been described from fungi or bacteria. AxlA of Aspergillus niger is a secreted α-xylosidase that was earlier shown to promote the release of free glucose (Glc) and xylose (Xyl) from substrates containing α-linked xylose, including isoprimeverose (IP), the heptasaccharide subunit of pea xyloglucan (XG), and tamarind XG. Results: The utility of AxlA for enhancing release of free Glc and Xyl in combination with commercial enzyme cocktails from dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants was examined. Without AxlA supplementation, a mixture of CTec2 and HTec2 (both of which are derived from T. reesei) did not release significant levels of Glc from pea XG or tamarind XG. This is consistent with their lack of detectable α-xylosidase activity using model substrates. On alkaline hydrogen peroxide-pretreated corn stover, supplementation of CTec2/HTec2 (at a loading of 2.5 mg/g glucan) with AxlA (at a loading of 8 mg/g glucan) increased Glc yields from 82% to 88% of the total available Glc and increased Xyl yields from 55% to 60%. AxlA supplementation also improved Glc yields from corn stover treated with the commercial cellulase Accellerase 1000. The AxlA enhancement was not a general protein effect because bovine serum albumin or bovine gamma-globulin at similar concentrations did not enhance Glc yields from corn stover in response to CTec2/HTec2. Supplementation of CTec2/HTec2 with AxlA did not enhance Glc release from pretreated green or etiolated pea tissue. However, AxlA did enhance Glc and Xyl yields compared to CTec2/HTec2 alone from another dicotyledonous herbaceous plant, Chenopodium album (lamb's quarters). Conclusion: Supplementation of commercial cellulase cocktails with AxlA enhances yields of Glc and Xyl from some biomass substrates under some conditions, and may prove useful in industrial lignocellulose conversion. © 2013 Jabbour et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","[TITLE] enhancement of fermentable sugar yields by α-xylosidase supplementation of commercial cellulases [KEYWORDS] aspergillus niger biofuel cellulase corn stover lignocellulose trichoderma reesei xyloglucan [ABSTRACT] background: although α-linked xylose is a major constituent of the hemicelluloses of land plants, few secreted α-xylosidases have been described from fungi or bacteria. axla of aspergillus niger is a secreted α-xylosidase that was earlier shown to promote the release of free glucose (glc) and xylose (xyl) from substrates containing α-linked xylose, including isoprimeverose (ip), the heptasaccharide subunit of pea xyloglucan (xg), and tamarind xg. results: the utility of axla for enhancing release of free glc and xyl in combination with commercial enzyme cocktails from dicotyledonous and monocotyledonous plants was examined. without axla supplementation, a mixture of ctec2 and htec2 (both of which are derived from t. reesei) did not release significant levels of glc from pea xg or tamarind xg. this is consistent with their lack of detectable α-xylosidase activity using model substrates. on alkaline hydrogen peroxide-pretreated corn stover, supplementation of ctec2/htec2 (at a loading of 2.5 mg/g glucan) with axla (at a loading of 8 mg/g glucan) increased glc yields from 82% to 88% of the total available glc and increased xyl yields from 55% to 60%. axla supplementation also improved glc yields from corn stover treated with the commercial cellulase accellerase 1000. the axla enhancement was not a general protein effect because bovine serum albumin or bovine gamma-globulin at similar concentrations did not enhance glc yields from corn stover in response to ctec2/htec2. supplementation of ctec2/htec2 with axla did not enhance glc release from pretreated green or etiolated pea tissue. however, axla did enhance glc and xyl yields compared to ctec2/htec2 alone from another dicotyledonous herbaceous plant, chenopodium album (lamb's quarters). conclusion: supplementation of commercial cellulase cocktails with axla enhances yields of glc and xyl from some biomass substrates under some conditions, and may prove useful in industrial lignocellulose conversion. © 2013 jabbour et al.; licensee biomed central ltd."

Drawing on Ackers sociological concept of inequality regimes, we analyze workforce profiles informed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics data, and qualitative interview data with human resource personnel. Emphasis is given to gender and Indigeneity, and the recruitment and retention practices by place and organization. We argue that the term 'skill shortage' is contentious as current workforce profiles are narrow and thereby exclude segments of the rural labor market. We also argue that underlying assumptions about gender and race in organizations need to be addressed for rural-based organizations to more fully utilize the available workforce.

79952068928,1,Abe Isoo and Kawakami Hajime in interwar Japan - Economic reform or revolution?,Austerity campaign Birth control Economic reform National polity (kokutai) Overpopulation State economic control Unemployment,"This article explores the views of two eminent professors of economics, Abe Isoo (1865-1949) and Kawakami Hajime (1879-1946), regarding their socialist economic theories for easing poverty in Japan during the interwar years (1918-1939). Prior to this period, Abe believed the cure to capitalism's ills lay in a combination of socialist economic reforms (sangyô demokurashii) and individual spiritual refinement. Kawakami, at that time a bourgeois economist, prioritised the spiritual revolution of the rich over any socialist-type economic reform. Thus, although convinced of the need for a different approach to eradicating poverty, they nevertheless agreed in the need for gradual change rather than radical reform (Gavin East Asia An International Quarterly 24:1, 30). The year 1928 marked a significant turning point both for Japanese social movements and in the lives of Abe and Kawakami. That year heralded Japan's first national election under the new Universal Male Suffrage Law, and saw the police exercise their extended authority as they undertook a nationwide round-up of students and intellectuals suspected of left-wing tendencies (the March 15 Incident). Also in that year, Abe and Kawakami resigned from academic posts to dedicate themselves to alleviating the privations of the working class. Abe, by then well known as the father of Japanese socialism and as a Christian pacifist, became a symbolic figure for Japan's working class parties, although he later came to support the government during WWII. Kawakami, who was forced to resign from his post during the round-up, ""washed his hands of bourgeois economics"", became a prominent spokesman for Marxism in Japan ([28], xi, pp. 76, 169). This article will reveal that both Abe and Kawakami's social and economic theories changed during the interwar period, so that Abe came to see imperial sovereignty as crucial to socialist economic reform, while Kawakami came to see it as a minion of the capitalists and advocated institutional and political revolution. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","[TITLE] abe isoo and kawakami hajime in interwar japan - economic reform or revolution?
