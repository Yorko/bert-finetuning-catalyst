Uncertainty associated with measuring instruments is analyzed, and an interpretation is presented in terms of the electric power generated. In addition, a methodology is proposed to generate scenarios of energy production used in financial evaluations, which is possible since the wind speed data used retain its uncertainty.

33846017313,7,Aspect ratio dependencies of D-3He fueled tokamak reactors,D-3He fusion Hot ion mode Medium aspect ratio tokamak Spherical tokamak,"Ignition capability is studied and compared for two types of D-3He spherical tokamak (ST) and medium aspect ratio tokamak (MT) reactors. The required power fraction to ions for maintaining the hot ion mode, which is indispensable for D-3He fusion, is smaller in a ST reactor than that in a MT reactor due to the lower synchrotron radiation loss. It is found that the nuclear elastic scattering capable of supplying 40% of the fusion energy to ions is enough to maintain the hot ion mode in the D-3He ST reactor with the high wall reflectivity.

84964826141,7,Estimating CO2 emissions reduction from renewable energy use in Italy,CO2 emissions Power plants Renewable sources Unit commitment,"Many Public Administrations are supporting the installation of Renewable Energy Systems (RE, namely wind and photovoltaic), which provide almost carbon free sources of electricity, aiming to curtail CO2 emissions of the power generation sector. However, the real effect in terms of carbon dioxide reductions is still unclear, since the uncertainty and variability characterizing RE must be balanced by conventional generators. The model presented here simulates the technical constraints of power plants and the economic framework to be found in a national electricity market, and estimates carbon dioxide emissions. The results show that the reduction of CO2 emissions is lower than expected considering the amount of energy produced from renewable sources, and is related to the level of RE penetration and the season of the year; in summer the reduction is slightly greater, because of the higher production by Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGTs) and the consequent decrease of that generated by the more pollutant coal power plants. The amount of reserve allocated by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) and the cycling on hourly basis have negligible effects on the carbon intensity of electricity generation.

85019843665,7,Clarifying thermal comfort of healthcare occupants in tropical region: A case of indoor environment in Thai hospitals,Healthcare facility Indoor environment Thermal comfort Tropical region,"Because the thermal environment affects both physical and psychological health, the issue of maintaining comfort in hospital is vital. For assessing the hospital indoor environment, it is still doubtful whether the predicted mean vote (PMV) model and comfort criteria of ASHRAE Standard 55 are applicable to healthcare occupants. The number of studies that have examined thermal comfort in healthcare is very limited. Therefore, this research aims to clarify the thermal comfort of healthcare occupants, validate the usability of the PMV model and determine whether the comfort criteria of current hospital standards are suitable for a tropical region. A field survey was conducted in two general hospitals in Bangkok. The data sets of patients, visitors and staff were analysed separately to understand their specific requirements. This was done by comparing objective parameters according to comfort criteria of ASHRAE Standard 55 and subjective measurements of actual comfort. The results showed that the PMV model mismatched thermal comfort for healthcare occupants in the tropics, particularly for medical staff. The preferred temperature for the thermal comfort of tropical occupants was slightly colder than neutral, although patients preferred warmer temperatures than other occupants. The acceptable temperature range for patient, visitor, and medical staff are at 21.8–27.9, 22.0–27.1, and 24.1–25.6 °C respectively, which is warmer than suggested by the Thai standard. As a result, to optimally enhance the comfort and health of occupants in a healthcare facility in tropical regions, the standard used for hospital environments must be carefully integrated and revised in accordance with the different requirements for the thermal comfort of various healthcare occupants.","[TITLE] clarifying thermal comfort of healthcare occupants in tropical region: a case of indoor environment in thai hospitals [KEYWORDS] healthcare facility indoor environment thermal comfort tropical region [ABSTRACT] because the thermal environment affects both physical and psychological health, the issue of maintaining comfort in hospital is vital. for assessing the hospital indoor environment, it is still doubtful whether the predicted mean vote (pmv) model and comfort criteria of ashrae standard 55 are applicable to healthcare occupants. the number of studies that have examined thermal comfort in healthcare is very limited. therefore, this research aims to clarify the thermal comfort of healthcare occupants, validate the usability of the pmv model and determine whether the comfort criteria of current hospital standards are suitable for a tropical region. a field survey was conducted in two general hospitals in bangkok. the data sets of patients, visitors and staff were analysed separately to understand their specific requirements. this was done by comparing objective parameters according to comfort criteria of ashrae standard 55 and subjective measurements of actual comfort. the results showed that the pmv model mismatched thermal comfort for healthcare occupants in the tropics, particularly for medical staff. the preferred temperature for the thermal comfort of tropical occupants was slightly colder than neutral, although patients preferred warmer temperatures than other occupants. the acceptable temperature range for patient, visitor, and medical staff are at 21.8–27.9, 22.0–27.1, and 24.1–25.6 °c respectively, which is warmer than suggested by the thai standard. as a result, to optimally enhance the comfort and health of occupants in a healthcare facility in tropical regions, the standard used for hospital environments must be carefully integrated and revised in accordance with the different requirements for the thermal comfort of various healthcare occupants."

In this work, composites based on post-industrial waste or primary recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) and 5 wt.% of organic modified montmorillonite clays were melt compounded using a twin-screw extruder. A 2<sup>2</sup> factorial experimental design was used to study the compounding and processing variables: Organic modified montmorillonite with one or two hydrogenated tallow (initial basal spacing) and screw speed of the extruder. X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy suggest that a partial exfoliation of the organoclay in the recycled poly(butylene terephthalate) matrix was achieved for organic modified montmorillonite with lower initial basal spacing. On the other hand, formulations containing organic modified montmorillonite with higher initial basal spacing showed only intercalated structure.

Standard deviation (σ) of variability in load and net load (load net of wind) has been used when estimating the effect of wind power on the short term reserves of the power system. This method is straightforward and easy to use when data on wind power and load exist. In this paper, the use of standard deviation as a measure of reserve requirement is studied. The confidence level given by ±3-6 times σ is compared to other means of deriving the extra reserve requirements over different operating time scales. Also taking into account the total variability of load and wind generation and only the unpredicted part of the variability of load and wind is compared. Using an exceedence level can provide an alternative approach to confidence level by standard deviation that provides the same level of risk. The results from US indicate that the number of σ that result in 99% exceedence in load following time scale is between 2.3-2.5 and the number of σ for 99.7% exceedence is 3.4.

Experimental areas where significant progress has taken place are energy transport in the scrape-off layer (SOL) in particular of the anomalous transport scaling, particle transport in the SOL that plays a major role in the interaction of diverted plasmas with the main-chamber material elements, edge localized mode (ELM) energy deposition on material elements and the transport mechanism for the ELM energy from the main plasma to the plasma facing components, the physics of plasma detachment and neutral dynamics including the edge density profile structure and the control of plasma particle content and He removal, the erosion of low- and high-Z materials in fusion devices, their transport to the core plasma and their migration at the plasma edge including the formation of mixed materials, the processes determining the size and location of the retention of tritium in fusion devices and methods to remove it and the processes determining the efficiency of the various fuelling methods as well as their development towards the ITER requirements. This experimental progress has been accompanied by the development of modelling tools for the physical processes at the edge plasma and plasma-materials interaction and the further validation of these models by comparing their predictions with the new experimental results.

The bacterial community diversity and percent of their cell count of the bioreactor were ascertained using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) individually. Based on the comparison of bacterial structure and hydrogen production efficiency under different HRT, no conclusion could be made on whether the diversity of Clostridium community could directly affect the reactor performance in these two pH systems. However, bacterial cell counts showed that the viable number of dominated Clostridium sp. changed along with the hydrogen production rate (HPR). It was believed that it could directly affect the hydrogen production efficiency. The highest HPR and hydrogen yield (HY) occurred when the reactor was operated at HRT 0.5 h, while the ratio of Clostridium sp. cell count and Bifidobacterium sp. cell count over the total Eubacteria cell count were around 40% and 40-60%, respectively. Therefore, we suggested that bacterial species which could degrade starch, such as Bifidobacterium sp. in this study, broke down starch into small molecules first and then these less complex compounds were utilized by the Clostridium species for hydrogen production. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","[TITLE] microbial community structure of a starch-feeding fermentative hydrogen production reactor operated under different incubation conditions [KEYWORDS] dark fermentative hydrogen production fish microbial community structure pcr-dgge starch-feeding [ABSTRACT] the aim of this study was to establish the particular biohydrogen-production related microbial community structure in a starch-feeding dark fermentation agitated granular sludge bed (agsb) reactor which was operated under ph 6.0 and 5.5 as well as under different hydraulic retention times (hrts). the bacterial community diversity and percent of their cell count of the bioreactor were ascertained using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) individually. based on the comparison of bacterial structure and hydrogen production efficiency under different hrt, no conclusion could be made on whether the diversity of clostridium community could directly affect the reactor performance in these two ph systems. however, bacterial cell counts showed that the viable number of dominated clostridium sp. changed along with the hydrogen production rate (hpr). it was believed that it could directly affect the hydrogen production efficiency. the highest hpr and hydrogen yield (hy) occurred when the reactor was operated at hrt 0.5 h, while the ratio of clostridium sp. cell count and bifidobacterium sp. cell count over the total eubacteria cell count were around 40% and 40-60%, respectively. therefore, we suggested that bacterial species which could degrade starch, such as bifidobacterium sp. in this study, broke down starch into small molecules first and then these less complex compounds were utilized by the clostridium species for hydrogen production. © 2008 international association for hydrogen energy."

Experiments were carried out in relation to the ratio of the catalyst to tyre feedstock and the temperature of the catalyst bed. Two Zeolite catalysts were examined, a Y-type Zeolite catalyst and Zeolite ZSM-5 catalyst of differing pore size and surface activity. The composition of the oils derived from the uncatalysed fluidised bed pyrolysis of tyres showed that benzene concentration was 0.2 wt%, toluene concentration was 0.8 wt%, o-xylene was 0.3 wt%, m/p-xylenes were 1.8 wt% and limonene was 4.3 wt%. Benzene, toluene and xylenes present in the oils showed a significant increase in the presence of both of the catalysts. The maximum concentrations of these chemicals for the Y-Zeolite (CBV-400) catalyst was 1 wt% for benzene, 8wt% for toluene, 3 wt% for o-xylene and 8.5 wt% for m/p-xylenes, produced at a catalyst:tyre ratio of 1.5. There was less influence of catalyst temperature on the yield of benzene, toluene and xylenes, however, increasing the temperature of the catalyst resulted in a marked decrease in limonene concentration. The Y-type Zeolite catalyst produced significantly higher concentrations of benzene, toluene and xylenes which was attributed to the larger pore size and higher surface acidity of the Y-Zeolite catalyst compared to the Zeolite ZSM-5 catalyst.","[TITLE] fluidised bed catalytic pyrolysis of scrap tyres: influence of catalyst:tyre ratio and catalyst temperature [KEYWORDS] catalysis pyrolysis tyres wmr 595-3 [ABSTRACT] pyrolysis with on-line zeolite catalysis of scrap tyres was undertaken in a fluidised bed reactor with the aim of maximising the production of higher value single ring aromatic hydrocarbons in the derived oil. experiments were carried out in relation to the ratio of the catalyst to tyre feedstock and the temperature of the catalyst bed. two zeolite catalysts were examined, a y-type zeolite catalyst and zeolite zsm-5 catalyst of differing pore size and surface activity. the composition of the oils derived from the uncatalysed fluidised bed pyrolysis of tyres showed that benzene concentration was 0.2 wt%, toluene concentration was 0.8 wt%, o-xylene was 0.3 wt%, m/p-xylenes were 1.8 wt% and limonene was 4.3 wt%. benzene, toluene and xylenes present in the oils showed a significant increase in the presence of both of the catalysts. the maximum concentrations of these chemicals for the y-zeolite (cbv-400) catalyst was 1 wt% for benzene, 8wt% for toluene, 3 wt% for o-xylene and 8.5 wt% for m/p-xylenes, produced at a catalyst:tyre ratio of 1.5. there was less influence of catalyst temperature on the yield of benzene, toluene and xylenes, however, increasing the temperature of the catalyst resulted in a marked decrease in limonene concentration. the y-type zeolite catalyst produced significantly higher concentrations of benzene, toluene and xylenes which was attributed to the larger pore size and higher surface acidity of the y-zeolite catalyst compared to the zeolite zsm-5 catalyst."
142152630,13,Improving the realism of modeling agronomic adaptation to climate change: Simulating technological substitution,missing,"The purpose of the paper is to propose and test a new approach to simulating farmers' agronomic adaptation to climate change based on the pattern of adoption of technological innovation/substitution over time widely described as a S-shaped (or logistic) curve, i.e., slow growth at the beginning followed by accelerating and then decelerating growth, ultimately leading to saturation. The approach we developed is tested using the Erosion Productivity Impact Calculator crop model applied to corn production systems in the southeastern U.S. using a high-resolution climate change scenario. Corn is the most extensively grown crop in the southeastern U.S. The RegCM limited area model nested within the CSIRO general circulation model generated the scenario. We compare corn yield outcomes using this new form of adaptation (logistic) with climatically optimized (clairvoyant) adaptation. The results show logistic adaptation to be less effective than clairvoyant adaptation in ameliorating climate change impacts on yields, although the differences between the two sets of yields are statistically significant in one case only. These results are limited by the reliance on a single scenario of climate change. We conclude that the logistic technique should be tested widely across climate change scenarios, crop species, and geographic areas before a full evaluation of its effect on outcomes is possible.","[TITLE] improving the realism of modeling agronomic adaptation to climate change: simulating technological substitution [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] the purpose of the paper is to propose and test a new approach to simulating farmers' agronomic adaptation to climate change based on the pattern of adoption of technological innovation/substitution over time widely described as a s-shaped (or logistic) curve, i.e., slow growth at the beginning followed by accelerating and then decelerating growth, ultimately leading to saturation. the approach we developed is tested using the erosion productivity impact calculator crop model applied to corn production systems in the southeastern u.s. using a high-resolution climate change scenario. corn is the most extensively grown crop in the southeastern u.s. the regcm limited area model nested within the csiro general circulation model generated the scenario. we compare corn yield outcomes using this new form of adaptation (logistic) with climatically optimized (clairvoyant) adaptation. the results show logistic adaptation to be less effective than clairvoyant adaptation in ameliorating climate change impacts on yields, although the differences between the two sets of yields are statistically significant in one case only. these results are limited by the reliance on a single scenario of climate change. we conclude that the logistic technique should be tested widely across climate change scenarios, crop species, and geographic areas before a full evaluation of its effect on outcomes is possible."
79960356311,7,Recent progress towards an advanced spherical torus operating point in NSTX,missing,"Progress in the development of integrated advanced ST plasma scenarios in NSTX (Ono et al 2000 Nucl. Fusion 40 557) is reported. Recent high-performance plasmas in NSTX following lithium coating of the plasma facing surfaces have achieved higher elongation and lower internal inductance than previously. Analysis of the thermal confinement in these lithiumized discharges shows a stronger plasma current and weaker toroidal field dependence than in previous ST confinement scaling studies; the ITER-98(y, 2) scaling expression describes these scenarios reasonably well. Analysis during periods free of MHD activity has shown that the reconstructed current profile can be understood as the sum of pressure driven, inductive and neutral beam driven currents, without requiring any anomalous fast-ion transport. Non-inductive fractions of 65-70%, and βP > 2, have been achieved at lower plasma current. Some of these low-inductance discharges have a significantly reduced no-wall βN limit, and often have βN at or near the with-wall limit. Coupled m/n = 1/1 + 2/1 kink/tearing modes can limit the sustained β values when rapidly growing ideal modes are avoided. A βN controller has been commissioned and utilized in sustaining high-performance plasmas. 'Snowflake' divertors compatible with high-performance plasmas have been developed.

Sociological research dating back to the 1970s links rapid oil and gas development with overburdened municipal services, upended social and cultural patterns, and volatile economic growth. Research on technological risk has demonstrated communities can come to be associated with pollution and contamination, resulting in out-migration, declining amenity-led development, and decreased financial investment. Emerging shale energy case studies in Wyoming, Pennsylvania, North Dakota, and Texas show a similar, although nuanced, picture of these concerns. Yet, little data exists on the prevalence or magnitude of these risks in the current context of shale gas development.

TRZs were first introduced in Texas in 2007 as a tool to allow county and municipal governments to raise funds to help pay for transportation improvements using the property tax mechanism. Since then, the legislation has been amended to include other transportation modes, such as transit, rail, and parking facilities. Amendments passed in 2013 introduced the concept of port authority TRZ, which expanded authorized use of the tool to the state’s port authorities and navigation districts. Most of the existing funding tools available to Texas ports focus on the development of infrastructure within port property. Port authority TRZs complement existing funding sources by providing a funding tool flexible enough to fund port projects both inside and outside port property. Port authorities can take advantage of the TRZ concept to join forces with neighboring local governments and the Texas Department of Transportation to fund landside transportation enhancements that improve port accessibility and the regional economy. Currently, there are four active port authority TRZs in the following locations: Port of Beaumont, Port of Port Arthur, Port of Brownsville, and Sabine-Neches Navigation District. This paper summarizes the legal framework of port authority TRZs, describes the role that these TRZs play in port funding and finance, and presents highlights of the port authority TRZs that have already been established throughout the state.","[TITLE] leveraging the value of land and landside access to fund port infrastructure in texas [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] this paper introduces port authority transportation reinvestment zones (trzs), a funding tool created by the texas legislature to help fund long-term economic development port projects. trzs were first introduced in texas in 2007 as a tool to allow county and municipal governments to raise funds to help pay for transportation improvements using the property tax mechanism. since then, the legislation has been amended to include other transportation modes, such as transit, rail, and parking facilities. amendments passed in 2013 introduced the concept of port authority trz, which expanded authorized use of the tool to the state’s port authorities and navigation districts. most of the existing funding tools available to texas ports focus on the development of infrastructure within port property. port authority trzs complement existing funding sources by providing a funding tool flexible enough to fund port projects both inside and outside port property. port authorities can take advantage of the trz concept to join forces with neighboring local governments and the texas department of transportation to fund landside transportation enhancements that improve port accessibility and the regional economy. currently, there are four active port authority trzs in the following locations: port of beaumont, port of port arthur, port of brownsville, and sabine-neches navigation district. this paper summarizes the legal framework of port authority trzs, describes the role that these trzs play in port funding and finance, and presents highlights of the port authority trzs that have already been established throughout the state."

We find that migrant daughters from countries with higher gender equality levels obtain higher reading scores than comparable migrant sons do (but this is not the case for math scores). In addition, the higher the gender equality levels in the destination countries, the lower the reading and math scores of both male and female migrants’ children in their destination countries. Further analyses suggest it is the difference between gender equality levels, rather than the levels themselves, that explains the educational performance of both female and male migrant pupils. Our results also show the low gender equality level in Islamic origin countries offers a possible explanation for the low educational performance of Islamic pupils, both male and female.

The same has achieved great economic growth, derived mainly from its mineral wealth. However, is still part of the low human development group with regard to the HDI, with 68% of the population living below the poverty line and 15% living in extreme poverty (second bulletin No. IFAD/23/08) with a consequent increasing rate of social inequality. The evaluation of the exploration and production (E&P) of oil in a country is essential for there to be a better use of the commodity for the purpose of economic growth and development. This article aims to explain the conditions, both social and economic consequences of Angola, to know whether the country has gained in quality of life with the national oil and gas activity. The variables to be examined are: the Human Development Index (HDI), Human Poverty Index (HPI), Infant Mortality Rate, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Indexes of Health and Demographic Trends. In what concerns the variables in the oil sector, it is observed: the daily production and proved reserves of oil and natural gas and oil GDP. This juxtaposition of social and economic indices for the period 2004-2010 will evaluate the effects of the insertion of Angola's oil production and gas worldwide, as part of OPEC since 2007. From the analysis made in this article enables us to say that oil is not bringing the expected social development for the country as the income generated by oil still remains concentrated in few hands, and the civil organization of the main culprits behind it. The process of political reconstruction of the country was late, allowed the first presidential elections only in 2008, which ended up hindering the effective implementation of an effective social inclusion plan.

However, volume change during cycling causes poor cycling stability and improving cycle life is a major research challenge. Herein, we present a strategy by fabricating reduced graphene oxide (rGO)-wrapped CuS hollow spheres using a simple solvothermal route assisted by ethylene glycol to improve the electrochemical performance of CuS in supercapacitors. The as-prepared samples are well characterized by utilizing Scan electron microscope, Transmission electron microscope, powder X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectrum and Raman spectra techniques. It is demonstrated that the obtained CuS/rGO composite shows excellent electrochemical performance as electrode material for supercapacitors. The CuS/rGO electrode displays a significantly enhanced specific capacitance of 2317.8 F g<sup>-1</sup> and an excellent cycling stability of 96.2% retention after 1200 cycles at a current density of 1.0 A g<sup>-1</sup>. The likely cause is the synergetic effects between the hollow spherical structure and the high conductivity of rGO.

This new facility is considered an important tool also for the successful development of the demonstration/prototype reactor (DEMO), because the DEMO scenarios can take valuable advantage by a preparatory activity on devices smaller than ITER with sufficient flexibility and capable plasma conditions, before to testing them on ITER itself. To keep the cost of this new facility low enough was chosen to use the copper as main conductor material for the toroidal and poloidal fields coils. So FAST is a compact (Ro = 1.82 m, a = 0.64 m, triangularity δ = 0.4) and cost effective machine consisting of 18 Toroidal Field Coils (TFC), 6 Central Solenoid (CS) coils, 6 External Poloidal coils (3+3), adiabatically heated during the plasma pulse and cooled down at cryogenic temperatures (30 K) by helium gas between two consecutive pulses [1], [2]. Then a careful consideration of thermal loads due to the high density currents circulating in the coils is mandatory to establish the limiting performances of this tokamak. Moreover FAST is a very demanding machine because of the large number of scenarios foreseen on it and this strong flexibility in operation capability doesn't allow to choose the more demanding scenario on a simple B2t criterion. In fact several scenarios are to be investigated to ascertain the more onerous conditions on the machine not only because of the non linear copper resistivity growth with the temperature but also due to its non linear variation with the applied magnetic fields. In this work the thermal analysis carried on the toroidal magnet are presented with particular regard to the role of the magneto-resistive effect and taking in account also the copper specific heat variation with temperature.

Location: Global. Methods: Patterns of recorded species invasions and pathways of introduction were mapped and visualized using data from the Global Invasive Species Database (GISD) and the CABI Invasive Species Compendium (CABI ISC), along with associated legal instruments relevant to IAS compiled from the ECOLEX database. A novel indicator of the asymmetry between each country's ‘ingress/egress’ of IAS (kappa, Κ), was developed to further explore spatial patterns. Results: Substantial variation in the spatial patterns of invasion was determined, with the Global North, some newly industrialized countries and small tropical islands being the main recipients of IAS and asymmetry (Κ) being highest in New World countries and small islands. Of the 1517 recorded IAS, 39% were introduced only intentionally and 26% only unintentionally, 22% both intentionally and unintentionally, while 13% had no information available. The dominant pathway for species invasions was horticulture and the nursery trade, with 31% of the species introduced outside of their natural geographical range. Large increases in legislation on IAS have occurred since the 1990s, particularly for those countries that have high numbers of species invasions. Main conclusions: Clear global patterns in the distributions of IAS are determined, supporting arguments emphasizing the role of colonial history, economic development and trade in driving the human-mediated movement of species. Dominant pathways for species invasions are similar across different regions. Policy responses towards IAS show an increasing desire from the international community to act on species invasions. Current patterns suggest that Africa and Central Asia are priority areas for future IAS research and control.","[TITLE] mapping the global state of invasive alien species: patterns of invasion and policy responses [KEYWORDS] biogeography distribution geographical pattern global database international treaties invasive alien species legislation pathways policy response [ABSTRACT] aim: to use global databases to (1) provide a visualization of global geographical patterns of species invasions, origins and pathways and (2) depict the international uptake of legislative and policy responses to invasive alien species (ias). location: global. methods: patterns of recorded species invasions and pathways of introduction were mapped and visualized using data from the global invasive species database (gisd) and the cabi invasive species compendium (cabi isc), along with associated legal instruments relevant to ias compiled from the ecolex database. a novel indicator of the asymmetry between each country's ‘ingress/egress’ of ias (kappa, κ), was developed to further explore spatial patterns. results: substantial variation in the spatial patterns of invasion was determined, with the global north, some newly industrialized countries and small tropical islands being the main recipients of ias and asymmetry (κ) being highest in new world countries and small islands. of the 1517 recorded ias, 39% were introduced only intentionally and 26% only unintentionally, 22% both intentionally and unintentionally, while 13% had no information available. the dominant pathway for species invasions was horticulture and the nursery trade, with 31% of the species introduced outside of their natural geographical range. large increases in legislation on ias have occurred since the 1990s, particularly for those countries that have high numbers of species invasions. main conclusions: clear global patterns in the distributions of ias are determined, supporting arguments emphasizing the role of colonial history, economic development and trade in driving the human-mediated movement of species. dominant pathways for species invasions are similar across different regions. policy responses towards ias show an increasing desire from the international community to act on species invasions. current patterns suggest that africa and central asia are priority areas for future ias research and control."

64349095032,8,Why we shouldn't turn our backs on financial globalization,missing,"This essay argues that financial globalization can be a powerful force in promoting economic growth and the reduction of poverty in emerging market countries. Financial development enables the financial system to allocate capital to its most productive uses and is crucial to the success of an economy. Financial globalization encourages financial development by weakening the power of groups such as government and entrenched private special interests, which have much to lose from an efficient financial system, and by encouraging support for institutional reforms to make the financial system work better. On the other hand, financial globalization, if it is not managed properly, has a dark side and can lead to financial crises that cause much economic hardship. Getting financial globalization to work well is no easy task and requires policies that promote property rights and good-quality financial information that encourage effective prudential supervision, and that promote a stable macroeconomic environment. Although these policies need to be home-grown, international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can create incentives to promote these policies in emerging market countries. Citizens in advanced countries can also help by supporting the opening up of their markets to goods and services from poorer countries, and thereby encourage expansion of their export sectors, which creates increased support for financial development and less vulnerability to financial crises. © 2009 International Monetary Fund.","[TITLE] why we shouldn't turn our backs on financial globalization [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] this essay argues that financial globalization can be a powerful force in promoting economic growth and the reduction of poverty in emerging market countries. financial development enables the financial system to allocate capital to its most productive uses and is crucial to the success of an economy. financial globalization encourages financial development by weakening the power of groups such as government and entrenched private special interests, which have much to lose from an efficient financial system, and by encouraging support for institutional reforms to make the financial system work better. on the other hand, financial globalization, if it is not managed properly, has a dark side and can lead to financial crises that cause much economic hardship. getting financial globalization to work well is no easy task and requires policies that promote property rights and good-quality financial information that encourage effective prudential supervision, and that promote a stable macroeconomic environment. although these policies need to be home-grown, international financial institutions like the international monetary fund and the world bank can create incentives to promote these policies in emerging market countries. citizens in advanced countries can also help by supporting the opening up of their markets to goods and services from poorer countries, and thereby encourage expansion of their export sectors, which creates increased support for financial development and less vulnerability to financial crises. © 2009 international monetary fund."

Most of the empirical analyses delving into this debate have focused on world countries, whose geographical and institutional conditions differ widely. Subnational analyses considering groups of countries with, in principle, more similar institutional and geographical conditions have been limited and tended to highlight that geography is more important than institutions at subnational level.

85072679567,7,A consideration on maximum efficiency of resonant circuit of inductive power transfer system with soft-switching operation,Battery charger Bi-directional Electric vehicles Improving efficiency Inductive power transfer (IPT) Maximum efficiency Soft switching Wireless power transfer Zero voltage switching (ZVS),"By using bi-directional inductive power transfer (IPT) systems as battery chargers for electric vehicles (EVs), battery charging operations become convenient and safe. However, IPT systems have problems such as occurrences of much electromagnetic noise and power loss because the converters of IPT systems are driven in high frequency by tens of kHz. To solve these problems, there is a case where the soft-switching technique needs to be applied to the converters of IPT systems. However, in soft-switching operation, the power factor of the resonant circuit becomes lower, resulting in a lower resonant circuit efficiency. In previous works, when the soft-switching technique was applied to the converters, the resonant circuit had not always been able to be operated with high efficiency because the influence caused by soft-switching operation had not been considered. For this reason, there was a case where the efficiency of the overall system with soft-switching operation became lower than the efficiency in hard-switching operation. Therefore, in this paper, the influence on the efficiency of the resonant circuit caused by the soft-switching operation is clarified by the theoretical analysis and experiments; then, the guideline for improving the efficiency of IPT systems is shown. As a result, in the experiments, it could be understood that the efficiency of the overall system with soft-switching operation becomes higher than the efficiency in hard-switching operation when the operating point of the resonant circuit was close to the requirement guideline, which is shown by using the primary-side voltage and the secondary-side voltage of the resonant circuit.

An easy and scalable thermal oxidation process in ambient atmosphere is employed to grow a CuxO film on Cu substrates. Electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, infrared and X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy are employed to obtain a deep understanding of the morphology, wettability, structure and composition of the copper oxides. We show that the annealing time strongly influences the nanostructures formation promoting the evolution of the oxide film from Cu2O to CuO/Cu2O bilayer with the subsequent growth of CuO nanowires. The obtained materials represent flexible and binder-free electrodes for pseudo-supercapacitors in which the current collector and the active element are joined in the same substrate without further processing.

However, the HST has proven to have negative effects on the H2 production performance from lignocellulosic substrates. We hypothesize that the negative effect of HST on H2 production from lignocellulosic substrates is due to the loss of species involved in cellulose solubilization. In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by applying a heat-shock pretreatment (105 °C/24 h)on the microbial community for producing hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose. Specifically, we compared a microbial community treated with 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES-treated control)versus a heat-shock pretreated microbial community. For both experimental treatments, we determined the major fermentation products (hydrogen, acetic, butyric, propionic, and isovaleric acids), as well as the diversity of bacteria and fungi using Illumina MiSeq of amplicons in five sampling points. We found that HST immediately reduced alpha diversity of microbial communities, being fungi more affected than bacteria. We also found that the bacterial reduction in Comamonas, Ureibacillus, and Aneurinibacillus was related to a low hydrogen production in the heat-shock pretreated community. Strictly anaerobic fungi such as Orpinomyces, Cyllamyces, and Neocallimastix, which are recognized by their role in solubilization of fibrous materials, were unable to survive the HST. The reconstructed bacterial network predicted positive interactions between cellulase-producing and hydrogen-producing families. We conclude that the HST did not promote the high microbial diversity required for hydrogen production from cellulose.","[TITLE] heat-shock treatment applied to inocula for h2 production decreases microbial diversities, interspecific interactions and performance using cellulose as substrate [KEYWORDS] co-occurrence network dark fermentation heat-shock treatment hydrogen [ABSTRACT] the heat-shock pretreatment (hst)is a useful method to select for h2-producing inocula when soluble substrates are employed. however, the hst has proven to have negative effects on the h2 production performance from lignocellulosic substrates. we hypothesize that the negative effect of hst on h2 production from lignocellulosic substrates is due to the loss of species involved in cellulose solubilization. in the present study, we tested this hypothesis by applying a heat-shock pretreatment (105 °c/24 h)on the microbial community for producing hydrogen from microcrystalline cellulose. specifically, we compared a microbial community treated with 2-bromoethanesulfonate (bes-treated control)versus a heat-shock pretreated microbial community. for both experimental treatments, we determined the major fermentation products (hydrogen, acetic, butyric, propionic, and isovaleric acids), as well as the diversity of bacteria and fungi using illumina miseq of amplicons in five sampling points. we found that hst immediately reduced alpha diversity of microbial communities, being fungi more affected than bacteria. we also found that the bacterial reduction in comamonas, ureibacillus, and aneurinibacillus was related to a low hydrogen production in the heat-shock pretreated community. strictly anaerobic fungi such as orpinomyces, cyllamyces, and neocallimastix, which are recognized by their role in solubilization of fibrous materials, were unable to survive the hst. the reconstructed bacterial network predicted positive interactions between cellulase-producing and hydrogen-producing families. we conclude that the hst did not promote the high microbial diversity required for hydrogen production from cellulose."
67651095771,13,Coal energy conversion with carbon sequestration via combustion in supercritical saline aquifer water,Aquifer sequestration CO2 capture Coal Supercritical water oxidation,"The standard idea for deep saline aquifer sequestration is to separate carbon dioxide from a process stream, compress it, and inject it underground. However, since carbon dioxide is less dense than water, even at the high pressures found in aquifers, it is buoyant and will move towards the surface unless trapped by an impermeable seal. Also, significant energy expenditure is required to separate and compress carbon dioxide, even though neat carbon dioxide is not a desired product. These issues may be addressed by combining the idea of fast dissolution at the surface with supercritical water oxidation (SCWO). By burning coal at high pressure in supercritical water drawn from an aquifer, and then sequestering the entire pre-equilibrated effluent, all carbon from the fuel is captured, as well as all non-mineral coal combustion products including sulfur and metals. A possible block diagram of an SCWO-based electric power plant is proposed, including processes to handle salts from the aquifer brine and minerals from coal. The plant is thermodynamically modeled, using an indirectly fired combined cycle to convert energy from hot combustion products to work. This model estimates the overall thermal efficiency that can be achieved, and reveals unanticipated interactions within the plant that have significant effects on efficiency.

Recently a new EC launcher, whose main goal is controlling tearing modes and possibly preventing their onset, is being implemented on FTU. So far most of the components of the launcher control strategy have been realized and successfully tested on plasma experiments. Nevertheless the operations of the new launcher must be completely integrated into the existing one, and to FTU control system. This work deals with this final step, proposing a hardware and software architecture implementing up to date technologies, to achieve a modular and effective control strategy well integrated into a legacy system.

However, in certain areas river discharges play also a principal role. The exploitation of the hydrokinetic resource in such areas has its own peculiarities, dictated by the combined influence of the two driving agents. The objective of this paper is to investigate the exploitation of hydrokinetic energy in the Miño Estuary, the largest estuary in NW Spain and N Portugal, with a focus on the site-specific performance of hydrokinetic energy converters (HECs) and its intra-annual variability. A state-of-the-art hydrodynamics numerical model is implemented and successfully validated based on field data. A third-generation HEC—to be more specific, the new Smart Freestream Turbine (SFT)—is considered, and its performance at the location with the greatest potential is assessed by means of: (i) site-specific efficiency, (ii) availability factor, and (iii) capacity factor. We find that, whereas the site-specific efficiency does not vary significantly, the availability and capacity factors do experience substantial intra-annual (seasonal) variability. In summer and autumn, river discharges are low, and the tide dominates the hydrokinetic resource. In contrast, during winter and spring, the river discharges significantly contribute to the resource, leading to a considerable increase in the availability and capacity factors. More generally, the results imply that in areas subject to combined fluvial and tidal influences the performance of HECs may depart significantly from that in tide-dominated areas, and this departure must be carefully weighed in assessing a project.","[TITLE] hydrokinetic energy exploitation under combined river and tidal flow [KEYWORDS] hydrokinetic energy hydrokinetic energy converter river discharge seasonal variability tidal stream energy [ABSTRACT] hydrokinetic energy has been mainly studied in areas where the principal driver of the current is the tide. however, in certain areas river discharges play also a principal role. the exploitation of the hydrokinetic resource in such areas has its own peculiarities, dictated by the combined influence of the two driving agents. the objective of this paper is to investigate the exploitation of hydrokinetic energy in the miño estuary, the largest estuary in nw spain and n portugal, with a focus on the site-specific performance of hydrokinetic energy converters (hecs) and its intra-annual variability. a state-of-the-art hydrodynamics numerical model is implemented and successfully validated based on field data. a third-generation hec—to be more specific, the new smart freestream turbine (sft)—is considered, and its performance at the location with the greatest potential is assessed by means of: (i) site-specific efficiency, (ii) availability factor, and (iii) capacity factor. we find that, whereas the site-specific efficiency does not vary significantly, the availability and capacity factors do experience substantial intra-annual (seasonal) variability. in summer and autumn, river discharges are low, and the tide dominates the hydrokinetic resource. in contrast, during winter and spring, the river discharges significantly contribute to the resource, leading to a considerable increase in the availability and capacity factors. more generally, the results imply that in areas subject to combined fluvial and tidal influences the performance of hecs may depart significantly from that in tide-dominated areas, and this departure must be carefully weighed in assessing a project."

85020003853,7,"A comparative study of anaerobic fixed film baffled reactor and up-flow anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor for biological removal of diethyl phthalate from wastewater: A performance, kinetic, biogas, and metabolic pathway study",Anaerobic treatment Biodegradation Biofilm Diethyl phthalate Hydraulic loading rate Organic loading rate Phthalic acid esters Wastewater,"Background: Phthalic acid esters, including diethyl phthalate (DEP), which are considered as top-priority and hazardous pollutants, have received significant attention over the last decades. It is vital for industries to select the best treatment technology, especially when the DEP concentration in wastewater is high. Meanwhile, anaerobic biofilm-based reactors are considered as a promising option. Therefore, in the present study, for the biological removal of DEP from synthetic wastewater, two different anaerobic biofilm-based reactors, including anaerobic fixed film baffled reactor (AnFFBR) and up-flow anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor (UAnFFFBR), were compared from kinetic and performance standpoints. As in the previous studies, only the kinetic coefficients have been calculated and the relationship between kinetic coefficients and their interpretation has not been evaluated, the other aim of the present study was to fill this research gap. Results: In optimum conditions, 90.31 and 86.91% of COD as well as 91.11 and 88.72% of DEP removal were achieved for the AnFFBR and UAnFFFBR, respectively. According to kinetic coefficients (except biomass yield), the AnFFBR had better performance as it provided a more favorable condition for microbial growth. The Grau model was selected as the best mathematical model for designing and predicting the bioreactors' performance due to its high coefficients of determination (0.97 < R 2). With regard to the insignificant variations of the calculated Grau kinetic coefficients (K G) when the organic loading rate (with constant HRT) increased, it can be concluded that both of the bioreactors can tolerate high organic loading rate and their performance is not affected by the applied DEP concentrations. Conclusions: Both the bioreactors were capable of treating low-to-high strength DEP wastewater; however, according to the experimental results and obtained kinetic coefficients, the AnFFBR indicated higher performance. Although the AnFFBR can be considered as a safer treatment option than the UAnFFFBR due to its lower DEP concentrations in sludge, the UAnFFFBR had lower VSS/TSS ratio and sludge yield, which could make it more practical for digestion. Finally, both the bioreactors showed considerable methane yield; however, compared to the UAnFFFBR, the AnFFBR had more potential for bioenergy production. Although both the selected bioreactors achieved nearly 90% of DEP removal, they can only be considered as pre-treatment methods according to the standard regulations and should be coupled with further technology.","[TITLE] a comparative study of anaerobic fixed film baffled reactor and up-flow anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor for biological removal of diethyl phthalate from wastewater: a performance, kinetic, biogas, and metabolic pathway study [KEYWORDS] anaerobic treatment biodegradation biofilm diethyl phthalate hydraulic loading rate organic loading rate phthalic acid esters wastewater [ABSTRACT] background: phthalic acid esters, including diethyl phthalate (dep), which are considered as top-priority and hazardous pollutants, have received significant attention over the last decades. it is vital for industries to select the best treatment technology, especially when the dep concentration in wastewater is high. meanwhile, anaerobic biofilm-based reactors are considered as a promising option. therefore, in the present study, for the biological removal of dep from synthetic wastewater, two different anaerobic biofilm-based reactors, including anaerobic fixed film baffled reactor (anffbr) and up-flow anaerobic fixed film fixed bed reactor (uanfffbr), were compared from kinetic and performance standpoints. as in the previous studies, only the kinetic coefficients have been calculated and the relationship between kinetic coefficients and their interpretation has not been evaluated, the other aim of the present study was to fill this research gap. results: in optimum conditions, 90.31 and 86.91% of cod as well as 91.11 and 88.72% of dep removal were achieved for the anffbr and uanfffbr, respectively. according to kinetic coefficients (except biomass yield), the anffbr had better performance as it provided a more favorable condition for microbial growth. the grau model was selected as the best mathematical model for designing and predicting the bioreactors' performance due to its high coefficients of determination (0.97 < r 2). with regard to the insignificant variations of the calculated grau kinetic coefficients (k g) when the organic loading rate (with constant hrt) increased, it can be concluded that both of the bioreactors can tolerate high organic loading rate and their performance is not affected by the applied dep concentrations. conclusions: both the bioreactors were capable of treating low-to-high strength dep wastewater; however, according to the experimental results and obtained kinetic coefficients, the anffbr indicated higher performance. although the anffbr can be considered as a safer treatment option than the uanfffbr due to its lower dep concentrations in sludge, the uanfffbr had lower vss/tss ratio and sludge yield, which could make it more practical for digestion. finally, both the bioreactors showed considerable methane yield; however, compared to the uanfffbr, the anffbr had more potential for bioenergy production. although both the selected bioreactors achieved nearly 90% of dep removal, they can only be considered as pre-treatment methods according to the standard regulations and should be coupled with further technology."

A computer simulation of the overall heat transfer process within the in-cylinder was run. The experimental results were used to validate the adopted numerical model. One-dimensional gas dynamics were used to describe the flow and heat transfer in the components of the engine model. The engine model was simulated while varying the engine speed, equivalence ratio (φ), and start of injection (SOI) timing, respectively, as follows: 1800 ≤ rpm ≤ 5000, 0.2 ≤ φ ≤ 1.2, and 130°≤ SOI ≤ 70°before top dead center.

The results show that the equivalence ratio has a significant impact on the time-averaged heat transfer characteristics. This is a unique behavior that appears in the case of hydrogen-fueled engines due to the wide flammability range.

The econometric difficulties are similar to those that bedevil the literature on trade openness and growth though, if anything, they are more severe in the context of international finance. There is also little systematic evidence that financial opening raises welfare indirectly by promoting collateral reforms of economic institutions or policies. At the same time, opening the financial account does appear to raise the frequency and severity of economic crises. Nonetheless, developing countries continue to move in the direction of further financial openness. A plausible explanation is that financial development is a concomitant of successful economic growth, and a growing financial sector in an economy open to trade cannot long be insulated from cross-border financial flows. This survey discusses the policy framework in which financial globalization is most likely to prove beneficial for developing countries.

Pretreatment was required to deconstruct the intact structure by the removal of hemicellulose/lignin, improving the cellulose accessibility of enzyme. Combinatorial pretreatments with liquid hot water/H2SO4 and ethanol/NaOH of sugarcane bagasse were developed to improve enzymatic hydrolysis under mild conditions. Results: After one-step 60% ethanol containing 0.5% NaOH pretreatment with solid to liquid ratio of 1/10, the glucose yield after hydrolysis for 72 h with enzyme dosage of 20 FPU/g substrate was enhanced by 41% and 205% compared to that of NaOH or 60% ethanol pretreated solids, respectively. This improvement was correlated with the removal of hemicellulose and lignin. However, using combinatorial pretreatments with 1% H2SO4 followed by 60% ethanol containing 0.5% NaOH, the highest glucose yield with Tween 80 reached 76%, representing 84.5% of theoretical glucose in pretreated substrate. While retaining similar glucose yield, the addition of Tween 80 capacitated either a reduction of enzyme loading by 50% or shortening hydrolysis time to 24 h. However, the enhancement with the addition of Tween 80 decreased as hydrolysis time was extended. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a combinatorial pretreatment with 1% H2SO4 followed by 60% ethanol containing 0.5% NaOH had significant effects on improving the enzymatic hydrolysis of sugarcane bagasse. The addition of Tween 80 enabled reducing the enzyme loading or shortening the hydrolysis time.

85078084590,7,Comparing machine learning algorithms in predicting thermal sensation using ASHRAE Comfort Database II,Building environment Comfort model PMV Thermal comfort,"Predicting building occupants’ thermal comfort via machine learning (ML) is a hot research topic. Many algorithms and data processing methods have been applied to predict thermal comfort indices in different contexts. But few studies have systematically investigated how different algorithms and data processing methods can influence the prediction accuracy. In this study, we first summarized the recent literature from perspectives of predicted comfort indices, algorithms applied, input features, data sources, sample size, training proportion, predicting accuracy, etc. Then, we applied nine ML algorithms and three data sampling methods to predict the 3-point and 7-point thermal sensation vote (TSV) in ASHRAE Comfort Database II. The results show that with an accuracy of 66.3% and 61.1% for 3-point and 7-point TSV respectively, Random Forest (RF) has the best performance among the tested algorithms. Compared to the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) model, ML TSV models generally have higher accuracy in TSV prediction. Based on feature importance analysis, the air temperature, humidity, clothing, air velocity, age, and metabolic rate are the top six important features for TSV prediction. The RF algorithm can achieve 63.6% overall accuracy in TSV prediction with the top three features, which is only 2.6% lower than involving 12 input features. Further, this paper addressed other common considerations in ML comfort model establishment such as tuning hyperparameters, splitting of training and testing data, and encoding methods. We also provided Python and R programming codes and packages as appendixes, which can be a good reference for future studies.","[TITLE] comparing machine learning algorithms in predicting thermal sensation using ashrae comfort database ii [KEYWORDS] building environment comfort model pmv thermal comfort [ABSTRACT] predicting building occupants’ thermal comfort via machine learning (ml) is a hot research topic. many algorithms and data processing methods have been applied to predict thermal comfort indices in different contexts. but few studies have systematically investigated how different algorithms and data processing methods can influence the prediction accuracy. in this study, we first summarized the recent literature from perspectives of predicted comfort indices, algorithms applied, input features, data sources, sample size, training proportion, predicting accuracy, etc. then, we applied nine ml algorithms and three data sampling methods to predict the 3-point and 7-point thermal sensation vote (tsv) in ashrae comfort database ii. the results show that with an accuracy of 66.3% and 61.1% for 3-point and 7-point tsv respectively, random forest (rf) has the best performance among the tested algorithms. compared to the predicted mean vote (pmv) model, ml tsv models generally have higher accuracy in tsv prediction. based on feature importance analysis, the air temperature, humidity, clothing, air velocity, age, and metabolic rate are the top six important features for tsv prediction. the rf algorithm can achieve 63.6% overall accuracy in tsv prediction with the top three features, which is only 2.6% lower than involving 12 input features. further, this paper addressed other common considerations in ml comfort model establishment such as tuning hyperparameters, splitting of training and testing data, and encoding methods. we also provided python and r programming codes and packages as appendixes, which can be a good reference for future studies."

These challenges limit the maximum amount of power can be produced by PVs in LV and MV grids, called the hosting capacity (HC). Battery storage systems (BSSs) have been used in many studies to decrease the reverse power and improve the HC by controlling the active power. However, the influence of a central BSS on the HC can be greatly improved by using a quadratic power control, simultaneous active, and reactive power control, and by selecting of the optimal battery size, the converter size, and the place of the central BSS. The effectiveness of the quadratic power control was not seen in previous works due to the fact that grids with one level of voltage without modeling of MV/LV transformers were simulated. This paper develops a method to select the optimal size of the battery and converter unit as well as the optimal place of an LV-central BSS having an optimal quadratic power control. The simulation results show considerable effects of the optimal selection of an LV-central BSS on the HC improvement.","[TITLE] improving hosting capacity of rooftop pvs by quadratic control of an lv-central bss [KEYWORDS] battery storage system distribution grids hosting capacity reactive power control renewable energy sources [ABSTRACT] high integration of rooftop photovoltaic (pv) plants in distribution systems leads to new technical challenges: reverse-active power and voltage rise in low-voltage (lv) and medium-voltage (mv) grids. these challenges limit the maximum amount of power can be produced by pvs in lv and mv grids, called the hosting capacity (hc). battery storage systems (bsss) have been used in many studies to decrease the reverse power and improve the hc by controlling the active power. however, the influence of a central bss on the hc can be greatly improved by using a quadratic power control, simultaneous active, and reactive power control, and by selecting of the optimal battery size, the converter size, and the place of the central bss. the effectiveness of the quadratic power control was not seen in previous works due to the fact that grids with one level of voltage without modeling of mv/lv transformers were simulated. this paper develops a method to select the optimal size of the battery and converter unit as well as the optimal place of an lv-central bss having an optimal quadratic power control. the simulation results show considerable effects of the optimal selection of an lv-central bss on the hc improvement."

In the present work we have studied the variation of the electrolyte reduction state across the electrolyte thickness using spectroscopic techniques when the cell is operated under electrolysis mode. The experiments have been performed in two different 10Sc1CeSZ (10 mol% of Sc2O 3 and 1 mol% of CeO2 doped zirconia) electrolyte-based cells before and after electrolysis operation up to voltages of 2.8 and 1.8 V, respectively. Spatially resolved vibrational and Ce3+ electronic micro-Raman spectroscopy and Er3+ luminescence spectroscopy provides information about the structural changes and defect state along the electrolyte thickness. Whereas the cell remains unaltered when operating at voltages below 1.8 V, degradation was observed for the cell operated at voltages over 2 V, and the degradation is also increasing with the operation time. Different transformations in the 10Sc1CeSZ electrolyte have been observed. Crystalline structure change from cubic to rhombohedral, firstly appearing at the region near the Ni-YSZ electrode, was detected. The structure change has been further corroborated by XRD studies. The reduction of the electrolyte, as evidenced by the presence of Ce3+, was clearly observed in the electronic micro-Raman spectra. Inhibition of Er3+ luminescence has been associated to the presence of oxygen vacancy defects resulting from zirconia reduction.

On the basis of the optimal 30 sets of parameters, the ensemble simulations indicated the following: Regions I (northeastern China) and III2 (the mid-lower reaches of the Yangtze River) were considered to be the most vulnerable areas to ETS, with the medium YLETS of 18.4 and 12.9 %, respectively. Furthermore, large YLETS values (>10 %) were found in some portions of Region II (the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau), western Region III1 (the Sichuan Basin), the middle of Region IV_ER (southern China cultivated by early rice), and the west and southeast of Region IV_LR (southern China cultivated by late rice). Over the past several decades, a significant decrease in YLETS was detected in most of Region I and in northern Region IV_LR (with the medians of −0.53 and −0.28 % year−1, respectively). However, a significant increase was found in most of Region III (including III1 and III2) and in Region IV_ER, particularly in the last decade (2001–2010).

The highest hydrogen yield (75.3 mL/g-VS) was obtained with heat-treated FW at 15 g-VS/L. Lower substrate content could not provide enough organic matter for hydrogen fermentation, while higher substrate concentrations shifted the metabolic pathways from hydrogen fermentation to lactic acid fermentation by enriching the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), which lowered the slurry pH and decreased enzyme activity, resulting in a lower chemical oxygen demand (COD), volatile solid (VS), carbohydrate removal rate, and hydrogen yield. Compared with fresh FW, heat-treated FW is preferred for biohydrogen process with acetate as the main organic product.

Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel framework of smart home energy management systems incorporating both approaches, so that accurate power consumption monitoring and intuitive interaction with the home appliances are simultaneously achieved. The smart components directly control the appliances, while the central controller coordinates the data collection and communication. The key feature is the capability of automatically mapping the appliances to their corresponding sockets, reducing the necessity for manual initial setup. Numerical simulations prove the accuracy and efficiency of the framework.

This article investigates this benign view, analysing the assumptions upon which it is based and arguing that the relationship between air transport and economic benefits may be more complex than is commonly held. In particular, the benefits of air transport services may be highly unevenly distributed, with particular groups benefiting from air transport provision to a far greater extent than others.

The paper sheds light on the nature, organization and achievements of the project. Of late, the upland ethnic communities have received increased attention from development academics and activists alike.

One thousand families from four ethnic communities have been resettled. Each family has received ownership title to land, with a view to developing it through integrated homestead agroforestry and rubber plantations, and all necessary community facilities and services were also provided. To evaluate the performance of the programme, a survey was conducted through a semi-structured questionnaire (complemented by observation and ethno-histories). Major problems observed during the course of fieldwork included the inadequate and delayed release of funds, marginal participation of women in the project meetings, lack of base-line socio-economic, demographic and topographic information and the project staff's limited exposure to participatory working style.

85041628618,8,Understanding the spatiotemporal variation of urban land expansion in oasis cities by integrating remote sensing and multi-dimensional DPSIR-based indicators,Economic-socio-ecological indicators Support vector machine Sustainable urban development Urban land use changes Urban management and planning Urbanization,"Rapid urban land expansion not only stimulates socioeconomic development, but can lead to negative impacts that threaten regional food security, ecological construction, and sustainable urban development, including losses of cropland and habitats, the creation of housing bubbles, and reductions in biodiversity. Because these economic-socio-ecological problems are generally more serious in ecologically fragile areas, this study focuses on trends seen in Ganzhou District, a typical oasis city within the Heihe River Basin (HRB) in an arid-to-semi-arid area of China. We apply a remote-sensing (RS)-based method that incorporates 11 dimensional features of Thematic Mapper and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (TM/ETM+) images to map changes in urban land, and also develop a series of multi-dimensional indicators within a drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (DPSIR) framework to quantify urban land expansion. The results of this study show that the urban land area of Ganzhou District in 2016 had expanded by 394.43% from 1987 levels, from 1,979.64 ha to 9,787.86 ha. These increasing pressures, jointly driven by gross domestic product (GDP), urban population, cropland area, and the industrial structure indicator (ISI), have led to the worsening economic-socio-ecological states and impacts of urban land expansion. Specifically, between 1987 and 2016, expansion intensity (EIPI) and expansion rate pressure indicators (ERPI) increased from 60.27 ha/a to 520.88 ha/a, and from 3.04%/a to 10.21%/a, respectively. Thus, the state indicators of economic development (EDSI), population carrying capacity (FDSI), food security (FSSI), and ecological construction (ECSI) decreased by 2.21 × 103 USD/ha, 17.62 population/ha, 34.20, and 10.80, respectively. Moreover, the impact indicators of economic development (EDII), population carrying capacity (FDII), and food security (FSII) decreased by 150.68 × 103 USD/ha, 62.12 population/ha, and 27.31, respectively, while the ecological construction impact indicator (ECII) increased by 29.39 between 1997 and 2007 and decreased by 13.31 between 2007 and 2016. Data also show that the area and proportion of cropland and ecological land occupied by urban land expansion increased over time. We therefore propose a series of economic-socio-ecological responses to help limit urban sprawl and foster compact green cities. Measures include planning urban growth boundaries, revitalizing urban centers and brownfields, using and re-using urban land more efficiently, strengthening land regulations, curbing excessive cropland expansion, cultivating more urban green spaces, and optimizing the trade-offs and synergies between multiple conflicting dimensions.","[TITLE] understanding the spatiotemporal variation of urban land expansion in oasis cities by integrating remote sensing and multi-dimensional dpsir-based indicators [KEYWORDS] economic-socio-ecological indicators support vector machine sustainable urban development urban land use changes urban management and planning urbanization [ABSTRACT] rapid urban land expansion not only stimulates socioeconomic development, but can lead to negative impacts that threaten regional food security, ecological construction, and sustainable urban development, including losses of cropland and habitats, the creation of housing bubbles, and reductions in biodiversity. because these economic-socio-ecological problems are generally more serious in ecologically fragile areas, this study focuses on trends seen in ganzhou district, a typical oasis city within the heihe river basin (hrb) in an arid-to-semi-arid area of china. we apply a remote-sensing (rs)-based method that incorporates 11 dimensional features of thematic mapper and enhanced thematic mapper plus (tm/etm+) images to map changes in urban land, and also develop a series of multi-dimensional indicators within a drivers, pressures, states, impacts, and responses (dpsir) framework to quantify urban land expansion. the results of this study show that the urban land area of ganzhou district in 2016 had expanded by 394.43% from 1987 levels, from 1,979.64 ha to 9,787.86 ha. these increasing pressures, jointly driven by gross domestic product (gdp), urban population, cropland area, and the industrial structure indicator (isi), have led to the worsening economic-socio-ecological states and impacts of urban land expansion. specifically, between 1987 and 2016, expansion intensity (eipi) and expansion rate pressure indicators (erpi) increased from 60.27 ha/a to 520.88 ha/a, and from 3.04%/a to 10.21%/a, respectively. thus, the state indicators of economic development (edsi), population carrying capacity (fdsi), food security (fssi), and ecological construction (ecsi) decreased by 2.21 × 103 usd/ha, 17.62 population/ha, 34.20, and 10.80, respectively. moreover, the impact indicators of economic development (edii), population carrying capacity (fdii), and food security (fsii) decreased by 150.68 × 103 usd/ha, 62.12 population/ha, and 27.31, respectively, while the ecological construction impact indicator (ecii) increased by 29.39 between 1997 and 2007 and decreased by 13.31 between 2007 and 2016. data also show that the area and proportion of cropland and ecological land occupied by urban land expansion increased over time. we therefore propose a series of economic-socio-ecological responses to help limit urban sprawl and foster compact green cities. measures include planning urban growth boundaries, revitalizing urban centers and brownfields, using and re-using urban land more efficiently, strengthening land regulations, curbing excessive cropland expansion, cultivating more urban green spaces, and optimizing the trade-offs and synergies between multiple conflicting dimensions."

33646542976,7,Ethanol/water mixture permeation behavior through membrane electrode assembly (MEA) in PEMFC,missing,"Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) have been paid more and more attention in recent years due to the following advantages of ethanol: low toxicity, renewability and easy production by the fermentation of agricultural products [1]. Based on the present status of the electrolyte development, Naifon® membrane series is the most commonly used. It is well known that its conductivity is dependent on the water content in the membrane in a more a less linear fashion [2]. This necessitates sufficient water in the polymer electrolyte. On the other hand, water content can not be so high that the electrode will be flooded. Proper management of water through the membrane is indispensable for the desirable cell performance. Furthermore, ethanol can also permeate across Nafion® membranes, leading to a mixed potential and catalyst poison at the cathode, consequently causing the decreased cell performance and fuel utilization [3]. These both issues make it necessary to investigate the ethanol/water permeation behavior through membrane electrode assembly in PEMFCs. In the present work, water and ethanol crossover rates through membrane electrode assembly (MEA) were determined in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEMFC). The investigated MEA consisted of two Pt/C electrodes (40 wt. %) and a Nafion®-115 membrane as the electrolyte. The anode compartment was pumped by ethanol aqueous solutions with different concentrations, and the cathode was supplied with high-purity helium at different flow rates to sweep off the permeated ethanol and water. The effluent from the cathode was on-line determined by gas Chromatograph (GC-14B, Shimadzu). The effect of the operation parameters such as the cell temperature, the carrier gas (He) flowrate at the cathode and the concentration of ethanol aqueous solutions on the ethanol/water permeation behavior was investigated. Based on the experimental results, it was found that the crossover rates of both water and ethanol increase with the increment of the operation temperature and the carrier gas (He) flow rate at the cathode. It was also found that the ethanol concentration had a significant effect on the crossover rates of ethanol and water. In the case of ethanol, the permeation rates presented a volcano behavior as the ethanol concentration increased, reaching a peak value when the ethanol concentration was 6.0 mol/L, which could be attributable to the different swelling behavior of Nafion® membrane in different ethanol aqueous solutions.","[TITLE] ethanol/water mixture permeation behavior through membrane electrode assembly (mea) in pemfc [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] direct ethanol fuel cells (defcs) have been paid more and more attention in recent years due to the following advantages of ethanol: low toxicity, renewability and easy production by the fermentation of agricultural products [1]. based on the present status of the electrolyte development, naifon® membrane series is the most commonly used. it is well known that its conductivity is dependent on the water content in the membrane in a more a less linear fashion [2]. this necessitates sufficient water in the polymer electrolyte. on the other hand, water content can not be so high that the electrode will be flooded. proper management of water through the membrane is indispensable for the desirable cell performance. furthermore, ethanol can also permeate across nafion® membranes, leading to a mixed potential and catalyst poison at the cathode, consequently causing the decreased cell performance and fuel utilization [3]. these both issues make it necessary to investigate the ethanol/water permeation behavior through membrane electrode assembly in pemfcs. in the present work, water and ethanol crossover rates through membrane electrode assembly (mea) were determined in a polymer electrolyte fuel cell (pemfc). the investigated mea consisted of two pt/c electrodes (40 wt. %) and a nafion®-115 membrane as the electrolyte. the anode compartment was pumped by ethanol aqueous solutions with different concentrations, and the cathode was supplied with high-purity helium at different flow rates to sweep off the permeated ethanol and water. the effluent from the cathode was on-line determined by gas chromatograph (gc-14b, shimadzu). the effect of the operation parameters such as the cell temperature, the carrier gas (he) flowrate at the cathode and the concentration of ethanol aqueous solutions on the ethanol/water permeation behavior was investigated. based on the experimental results, it was found that the crossover rates of both water and ethanol increase with the increment of the operation temperature and the carrier gas (he) flow rate at the cathode. it was also found that the ethanol concentration had a significant effect on the crossover rates of ethanol and water. in the case of ethanol, the permeation rates presented a volcano behavior as the ethanol concentration increased, reaching a peak value when the ethanol concentration was 6.0 mol/l, which could be attributable to the different swelling behavior of nafion® membrane in different ethanol aqueous solutions."

Design/methodology/approach: The authors use event-study to build the research framework. Using CSR report content analysis, the authors measure the specification level of CSR disclosure. Applying the Baidu index, the authors mine Chinese investors’ profiles data to investigate retail investor heterogeneity closely. Findings: The authors find strong evidence that the measure captures a behavioral bias in CSR pricing: firms that choose to disclose CSR report experience positive abnormal return more among retail investors than institutional investors, more among young investors than older, but no difference between female and male investors. Practical implications: For Chinese public firms, the authors give them evidence that they can realize positive abnormal returns by applying certain CSR disclosure strategies. For Chinese investors, especially retail investors and youths, the authors ask them to rethink whether their positive evaluation of CSR is a rational trade-off choice or whether they are fooled by the “hedging mask” and “attention-grabbing.” Social implications: The findings can give some suggestions to regulators: encouraging voluntary disclosure and reducing mandatory disclosure can drive enterprises to engage in more CSR activities because the voluntarily CSR disclosure can realize both long-term value and “spot value.” Complementarily, a more rigorous CSR report auditing regulation can suppress the “greenwash” by increasing the “lying cost.” Originality/value: Using behavioral finance theory, the authors connect the gap between neoclassical research on the “U-shaped” value realization of CSR and the increasing voluntary CSR disclosure in the Chinese market.

Such changes are likely to have also produced changes in the patterns and numbers of road traffic injuries, including increases in motorcycle injuries. However, such changes have not been well documented. The work described in this paper sought, therefore, to document the changes in motorcycle ownership, motorcyclist mortality and injury rates in China since 1987. METHODS: National traffic ownership and injury data from 1987 to 2001 were obtained from the National Bureau for Traffic Administration. Additionally, traffic ownership and injury records from 1997 to 2001 were collected from local police offices from 20 counties in Guangxi Region. Population data were obtained from the national and county statistics bureaus. Motorcycle ownership, fatality and injury trends over time were calculated. RESULTS: Nationally, motorcycles accounted for 23.4% of all registered motor vehicles in 1987, increasing to 63.2% in 2001. Motorcyclist fatalities and injuries increased 5.5-fold and 9.3-fold, respectively, between 1987 and 2001. In 1987, 7.5% of all traffic fatalities and 8.8% of all traffic injuries were sustained by motorcyclists, with the corresponding proportions increasing to 18.9% and 22.8%, respectively, in 2001. The changing proportions of both traffic fatalities and injuries sustained by motorcyclists were positively correlated with the change in the proportion of motorcycles among all motor vehicles. In the 20 counties in Guangxi, motorcyclist fatality and injury rates also increased between 1997 and 2001. Moreover, these rates were considerably higher than the national rates. CONCLUSIONS: Motorcyclist injury in China is a serious public health problem. Motorcyclist fatalities and injuries are likely to continue to increase unless appropriate intervention programmes are implemented.","[TITLE] motorcycle ownership and injury in china.

80052821905,7,Nonlinear multivariable modeling of solid oxide fuel cells using core vector regression,Black-box modeling Core vector regression Nonlinear modeling Solid oxide fuel cell,"This paper presents new steady-state and dynamic models for solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) using core vector regression (CVR). So far, most of conventional SOFC models have been presented based on conversion laws. Due to complex mathematical equations used in these models, they are time-consuming and need large amount of memory to be applied for controller design, especially power electronic interface controller design, generation and load predictions, optimization and other studies. To overcome these problems, some black-box models, such as support vector machine (SVM) and artificial neural network (ANN)-based models have been also proposed for SOFC. In this paper, in order to model nonlinear multivariable behavior of SOFC two CVR-based black-box models are proposed for each operation mode, one for steady-state and the other one for dynamic modeling. The proposed models are trained in a very little time and need small amount of memory in comparison with existing black-box models. This is due to usage of fewer number of support vectors (SVs). In order to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed models, they are applied to a 5-kW SOFC stack. Simulation results illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models for both steady-state and dynamic studies. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

From the measured primary-neutron spectrum (13-15 MeV), yield (Yn) and hot-spot ion temperature (Ti) are determined. From the scattered neutron yield (10-12 MeV) relative to Yn, the down-scatter ratio, and the fuel areal density (ρR) are determined. These implosion parameters have been diagnosed to an unprecedented accuracy with a suite of neutron-time-of-flight spectrometers and a magnetic recoil spectrometer implemented in various locations around the NIF target chamber. This provides good implosion coverage and excellent measurement complementarity required for reliable measurements of Yn, Ti and ρR, in addition to ρR asymmetries. The data indicate that the implosion performance, characterized by the experimental ignition threshold factor, has improved almost two orders of magnitude since the first shot taken in September 2010. ρR values greater than 1 g cm-2 are readily achieved. Three-dimensional semi-analytical modelling and numerical simulations of the neutron-spectrometry data, as well as other data for the hot spot and main fuel, indicate that a maximum hot-spot pressure of ∼150 Gbar has been obtained, which is almost a factor of two from the conditions required for ignition according to simulations. Observed Yn are also 3-10 times lower than predicted.

The in vessel viewing system (IVVS) probe has been designed and built to perform sub-millimetric three-dimensional images inside ITER; it is based on an intrinsically radiation resistant concept and architecture. A first characterization of the IVVS probe under room conditions was made at Frascati Labs on a full-scale mock-up of the ITER first wall panel (FWP) and of the divertor vertical target. The first characterization demonstrated that an upgrade of the IVVS performances was necessary especially to cope with divertor surfaces made of carbon material, which is highly absorbent from optical point of view. The paper describes the new developments of IVVS prototype to increase range measurement performances that was obtained increasing the modulation frequency, the optical efficiency of the probe optics and the laser power. A new test campaign has been carried out on the upgraded IVVS and a compact characteristic curve describing its performances has been found both in mathematical and graphical form. As far as viewing is concerned, the system has confirmed the sub-millimetric viewing resolution, reaching in the worst cases ∼1 mm of resolution. The image quality was excellent in almost all the cases. The range measurement performance of IVVS system has been strongly upgraded reducing the standard deviation of range measure of a factor varying from 6 to 12.

However, high penetration of renewable energy by technologies such as photovoltaics (PV) decreases power generation from thermal power plants. As a result, supply and demand balancing capabilities can be reduced overall in power systems. Therefore, the capability of residential batteries in balancing supply and demand (particularly demand) is expected to contribute toward the preparation for massive introduction of renewable energy power generation. This work develops a residential battery optimum operation scheduling model using mixed integer linear programming for leveling a system load. Through the use of this model it can be determined whether many batteries can level the whole system load without sharing information on each battery state. It was found that the system load could be leveled effectively when batteries are charged by a lower power than by the rated power.","[TITLE] load leveling effects by massively introduced residential battery storage systems [KEYWORDS] battery demand response load leveling optimization peak load shifting [ABSTRACT] renewable energy is frequently promoted to improve sustainability and low carbonization of energy systems. however, high penetration of renewable energy by technologies such as photovoltaics (pv) decreases power generation from thermal power plants. as a result, supply and demand balancing capabilities can be reduced overall in power systems. therefore, the capability of residential batteries in balancing supply and demand (particularly demand) is expected to contribute toward the preparation for massive introduction of renewable energy power generation. this work develops a residential battery optimum operation scheduling model using mixed integer linear programming for leveling a system load. through the use of this model it can be determined whether many batteries can level the whole system load without sharing information on each battery state. it was found that the system load could be leveled effectively when batteries are charged by a lower power than by the rated power."

Weeds are a particular problem in the production of short rotation woody and perennial herbaceous biomass crops due to the shortage of registered herbicides and integrated weed management systems. Herbicides will be an important component of weed management of biomass crops. However, producers should take a broader view of weeds and incorporate all available weed management tactics in these production systems. In both short rotation poplar and herbaceous perennial crops, weed control during the establishment period is most critical. New plantings of these species grow very slowly and do not compete well with weeds until a canopy develops. Effective weed control can double the growth of short rotation poplar crops and affect the variability of the resulting stand. In crops like switchgrass, uncontrolled weeds during establishment can result in stand failure. Cultural practices such as site preparation, using weed-free seed, fallowing, selecting the proper planting dates, companion crops and controlling weeds in previous crops must be combined with herbicides to develop integrated management systems. Weeds may also cause problems in established stands through competition with the biomass crop and by contaminating the product. Effective and economical weed management systems will be essential for the development of short rotation woody and herbaceous perennial biomass crop production systems.","[TITLE] weed management in short rotation poplar and herbaceous perennial crops grown for biofuel production [KEYWORDS] herbicides integrated weed management switchgrass weed control [ABSTRACT] weed management is a key element of any crop production system. weeds are a particular problem in the production of short rotation woody and perennial herbaceous biomass crops due to the shortage of registered herbicides and integrated weed management systems. herbicides will be an important component of weed management of biomass crops. however, producers should take a broader view of weeds and incorporate all available weed management tactics in these production systems. in both short rotation poplar and herbaceous perennial crops, weed control during the establishment period is most critical. new plantings of these species grow very slowly and do not compete well with weeds until a canopy develops. effective weed control can double the growth of short rotation poplar crops and affect the variability of the resulting stand. in crops like switchgrass, uncontrolled weeds during establishment can result in stand failure. cultural practices such as site preparation, using weed-free seed, fallowing, selecting the proper planting dates, companion crops and controlling weeds in previous crops must be combined with herbicides to develop integrated management systems. weeds may also cause problems in established stands through competition with the biomass crop and by contaminating the product. effective and economical weed management systems will be essential for the development of short rotation woody and herbaceous perennial biomass crop production systems."
85042903625,7,Energy analysis of poplar production for bioenergy in Sweden,Bioenergy Energy balance Energy efficiency Energy ratio Poplar Populus spp.,"Poplar (Populus spp.) species are currently not widely grown in Sweden but offer interesting options for future large-scale biomass production for bioenergy. This study assesses the average annual net energy yield and the ratio between the gross energy yield and the total primary energy input for well-managed current commercial poplar production systems in Sweden, with and without fertilization with mineral nitrogen (N). The two systems perform similarly, mainly because the yield response to fertilization is estimated to be small. The average annual net energy yields with and without fertilization are estimated at 190 and 179 GJ ha−1 yr−1, respectively. The corresponding energy ratios are 32 and 34, i.e., the total primary energy inputs correspond to only ca. 3% of the gross energy yield, in both cases. Therefore, improving the net energy yield by increasing the harvest level may be considered the most important objective from an energy performance point of view. To do this, more research is needed in order to develop poplar clones that are better adapted to the Swedish climate and identify in which situations poplar responds well to fertilization. At the same time, by reducing the energy inputs associated with the most fuel-intensive activities (wood-chip transportation, chipping, harvesting, forwarding, and stump lifting), greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. The results should be interpreted with caution since several parameters, especially the yield response to fertilization and fuel consumption rates, are associated with considerable uncertainties.","[TITLE] energy analysis of poplar production for bioenergy in sweden [KEYWORDS] bioenergy energy balance energy efficiency energy ratio poplar populus spp. [ABSTRACT] poplar (populus spp.) species are currently not widely grown in sweden but offer interesting options for future large-scale biomass production for bioenergy. this study assesses the average annual net energy yield and the ratio between the gross energy yield and the total primary energy input for well-managed current commercial poplar production systems in sweden, with and without fertilization with mineral nitrogen (n). the two systems perform similarly, mainly because the yield response to fertilization is estimated to be small. the average annual net energy yields with and without fertilization are estimated at 190 and 179 gj ha−1 yr−1, respectively. the corresponding energy ratios are 32 and 34, i.e., the total primary energy inputs correspond to only ca. 3% of the gross energy yield, in both cases. therefore, improving the net energy yield by increasing the harvest level may be considered the most important objective from an energy performance point of view. to do this, more research is needed in order to develop poplar clones that are better adapted to the swedish climate and identify in which situations poplar responds well to fertilization. at the same time, by reducing the energy inputs associated with the most fuel-intensive activities (wood-chip transportation, chipping, harvesting, forwarding, and stump lifting), greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced. the results should be interpreted with caution since several parameters, especially the yield response to fertilization and fuel consumption rates, are associated with considerable uncertainties."

The dissolution rate of magnesium ions (Mg 2+ ) from thermally activated serpentine and the factors influencing the rate and extent of dissolution have been studied in our research group. The current contribution focuses on the effect of temperature and pH on the dissolution of heat activated lizardite (a polymorph of serpentine). The extent of dissolution of thermally activated lizardite was measured experimentally as a function of temperature (25 °C ≤ T ≤ 75 °C) and pH (1.2 ≤ pH ≤ 9.8). It was found that at higher temperatures the level of Mg extraction is greater during the initial stage of dissolution but is then hindered by the re-precipitation of amorphous silica. Thermodynamic modelling was used to assess the susceptibility of solid phase formation and confirmed the likelihood of re-precipitation of amorphous silica from the solutions. For the first time, in this work, the crackling core model (CCM) was used to model experimental data at different pH values.

We developed a unique backcasting approach combined with a spatial conservation prioritisation framework to identify priority areas for restoration offsetting. We calculated the past impacts of oil-palm development, quantified the future benefits of restoration for carbon storage and biodiversity over one oil-palm planting cycle of 25 years, and prioritised areas for restoration to balance the impacts and benefits for the least cost. We estimate that offsetting the carbon emissions attributable to the existing 4.6 Mha of industrial oil-palm plantation in Kalimantan is most cost-effectively achieved by restoring 0.4–1.6 Mha of degraded peatlands, including failed agricultural projects, at a cost of US$0.7–2.9 billion. On the other hand, offsetting biodiversity losses would require at least 4.7 Mha of degraded areas to be restored (equating to 8.7% of Kalimantan) at a cost of US$7.7 billion. We show that priority areas for offsetting biodiversity losses overlap poorly with those for compensating carbon emissions. Our analysis suggests that reconciling multiple impacts at landscape scales will necessitate difficult choices among contested socio-political preferences. Our findings also clarify the fundamental importance of conserving biodiversity-rich primary forests and peatlands in the tropics and the need to avoid converting these areas in the future.","[TITLE] restoration to offset the impacts of developments at a landscape scale reveals opportunities, challenges and tough choices [KEYWORDS] biodiversity habitat carbon storage elaeis guineensis indonesian borneo restoration planning trade-off [ABSTRACT] when development impacts a broad landscape and causes the loss of multiple ecosystem services, decisions about which of these impacts to offset must be made. we use industrial oil-palm developments in kalimantan and quantify the potential for restoration to offset oil-palm impacts on carbon storage and biodiversity. we developed a unique backcasting approach combined with a spatial conservation prioritisation framework to identify priority areas for restoration offsetting. we calculated the past impacts of oil-palm development, quantified the future benefits of restoration for carbon storage and biodiversity over one oil-palm planting cycle of 25 years, and prioritised areas for restoration to balance the impacts and benefits for the least cost. we estimate that offsetting the carbon emissions attributable to the existing 4.6 mha of industrial oil-palm plantation in kalimantan is most cost-effectively achieved by restoring 0.4–1.6 mha of degraded peatlands, including failed agricultural projects, at a cost of us$0.7–2.9 billion. on the other hand, offsetting biodiversity losses would require at least 4.7 mha of degraded areas to be restored (equating to 8.7% of kalimantan) at a cost of us$7.7 billion. we show that priority areas for offsetting biodiversity losses overlap poorly with those for compensating carbon emissions. our analysis suggests that reconciling multiple impacts at landscape scales will necessitate difficult choices among contested socio-political preferences. our findings also clarify the fundamental importance of conserving biodiversity-rich primary forests and peatlands in the tropics and the need to avoid converting these areas in the future."

The electrical straps will carry the eddy currents and halo currents from the blanket to the vessel minimising the current affecting the hydraulic connection. 3-D electromagnetic FEM models have been implemented to analyse the electromagnetic transients during the different phases of a disruption. The analysed transients include: eddy currents induced by a variation of all the magnetic field components, during both the thermal and the current quench phases and halo currents flowing from the plasma to the vessel during vertical displacement events (VDEs). The electromagnetic transients have been simulated by means of appropriate boundary conditions and harmonic analyses, at frequencies related to the time constant of each electromagnetic transient, have been carried out instead of transient analyses. The electrodynamic pressure, the resulting global forces and torques on the critical components of the electrical straps and on the branch pipes of hydraulic connection have been evaluated. As a result, it was assessed that the electrical straps convey more than 99% of the total current flowing from the blanket to the vessel.

To elucidate the influence of citric acid amount in preparation conditions on the structure and catalytic activity, we prepared catalysts with different citric acid to Mo molar ratios i.e. CA/Mo = 1, 2, 3 and 4. The catalytic activity was evaluated in the temperature range of 300–600 °C at atmospheric pressure. The catalytic activity of the tested samples has changed in the following order of CA/Mo atomic ratio of 1 < 2 < 3 > 4. Therefore, the catalyst prepared by using CA/Mo ratio = 3 showed the highest catalytic activity. BET, XRD, XPS, SEM and TEM-EDS techniques were been used to characterize the catalysts. The increased activity of Mo2N-3:1 and 3%Co-Mo2N-3:1 catalysts was due to increased surface area, decreased particle size and increased relative proportions of Mo2N and Co3Mo3N phases. The ammonia conversion for 3%Co-Mo2N catalyst was increased from 75 to 97% at 550 °C with the increase of CA/Mo ratio from 1 to 3. This enrichment of activity in 3%Co-Mo2N-3:1 catalyst is due to increased dispersion of Co3Mo3N microstructure on γ-Mo2N platelets confirmed by SEM and TEM results. No deactivation was observed for any catalysts investigated in this study for ammonia decomposition.","[TITLE] high performance of bulk mo2n and co3mo3n catalysts for hydrogen production from ammonia: role of citric acid to mo molar ratio in preparation of high surface area nitride catalysts [KEYWORDS] ammonia decomposition citric acid high surface area nitride catalysts hydrogen production [ABSTRACT] hydrogen production from ammonia decomposition was studied using a series of unsupported high surface area molybdenum nitride (mo2n) and cobalt promoted molybdenum nitride (3%co-mo2n) catalysts prepared with citric acid (ca) as a chelating agent. to elucidate the influence of citric acid amount in preparation conditions on the structure and catalytic activity, we prepared catalysts with different citric acid to mo molar ratios i.e. ca/mo = 1, 2, 3 and 4. the catalytic activity was evaluated in the temperature range of 300–600 °c at atmospheric pressure. the catalytic activity of the tested samples has changed in the following order of ca/mo atomic ratio of 1 < 2 < 3 > 4. therefore, the catalyst prepared by using ca/mo ratio = 3 showed the highest catalytic activity. bet, xrd, xps, sem and tem-eds techniques were been used to characterize the catalysts. the increased activity of mo2n-3:1 and 3%co-mo2n-3:1 catalysts was due to increased surface area, decreased particle size and increased relative proportions of mo2n and co3mo3n phases. the ammonia conversion for 3%co-mo2n catalyst was increased from 75 to 97% at 550 °c with the increase of ca/mo ratio from 1 to 3. this enrichment of activity in 3%co-mo2n-3:1 catalyst is due to increased dispersion of co3mo3n microstructure on γ-mo2n platelets confirmed by sem and tem results. no deactivation was observed for any catalysts investigated in this study for ammonia decomposition."

Method: Vermicompost prepared from cattle dung was mixed in different proportions, i.e. 0, 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100% vermicompost v/v with soil and commercial potting media (Perlite, Peat and Coconut coir). To study the germination, vegetative growth, reproductive growth and yield in two varieties of Linum usitassimum L. LC-54 and LC-2063 were grown in a polyhouse for a 2 years trial. A total of 960 seedlings and 240 plants were studied for assessment of result in 24 treatments. Additional treatments with foliar application of 1:1 v/v vermiwash and recommended dose of inorganic fertilizer were done to determine and compare the role of vermicompost, vermiwash and inorganic treatment. Results: Substituting soil with 60% (v/v) vermicompost in LC-54 and with 40% (v/v) vermicompost in LC-2063 improved the performance of seeds, root morphology and stem growth. Life cycle of crop was shortened in two varieties of Linseed raised under different treatments of vermicompost and vermiwash. Performance of LC-54 was better at 60% and that of LC-2063 was at 40%, which can be attributed to their genotypic differences. Vermicompost proportion above 60% was of no use at any stage of life cycle in both the varieties of Linum. Germination and yield were further improved when foliar application of vermiwash was integrated with vermicompost for nutrient management when compared with recommended chemical fertilizer treatment and control.

Starting from basic premises of ecological limits and social justice, the author examines the complex relationship between income and human well-being and argues that the rich world has a responsibility to ""make room for growth"" where it matters most in terms of improved well-being; that is, in the poorest nations. The paper argues that this cannot be achieved simply through efficiency improvements or material ""decoupling"". A simple scenario analysis is used to illustrate the heroic nature of the assumptions that decoupling can achieve global carbon targets. Even if such assumptions are technically justifiable, economic incentives and social logic conspire against technological improvements of this magnitude. Instead, there is a need for profound transformation of the economic system itself, for which the rich nations must take a primary responsibility. This transformation has implications for incentive structures, ownership patterns, investment portfolios, the organisation of financial markets, and the structure of economic activities and for expectations of economic growth.

The study reports on the synthesis of a novel quaternized poly ether ether ketone (QPEEK) membrane and subsequent utilization of the ionomer as an anion exchange membrane (AEM). The structural characterization of chloromethylation and quaternization of PEEK was confirmed by FT-IR and 1H1 NMR spectroscopy and the morphologies were viewed by scanning electron microscopy. The effects of oxygen crossover and specific substrate crossover on cathode potential were also studied in detail. The investigation of QPEEK with the commercially available AEM (AMI-7001) revealed that the QPEEK shows excellent static properties, i.e. ion-exchange capacity, water uptake, thickness, etc.; and kinetic properties, i.e. diffusion permeability and better durability over 250 days. Power density obtained from an MFC containing the QPEEK-AEM produced higher value (60 W/m3) than the commercial AMI-7001 AEM (52 W/m3).

The physicochemical properties of the prepared catalysts were characterized by H2-TPR, XRD, BET, and TEM. The research results show that the specific surface area, pore diameter, crystal size of Ni species, and catalytic performance of the Ni/KIT-6 catalysts are obviously affected by the Ni content. Increasing Ni content results in the increment of the crystal size of Ni species, while the dispersion of Ni species shows the opposite trend.

In general, the addition of some biological additives and subsequent storage for 7 weeks could enhance the biogas and biomethane production per ODM when compared to the untreated sample. A common microbial inoculent containing homo-fermentative and hetero-fermentative bacteria (Bonsilage Mais®), had no beneficial effect on biogas and biomethane production compared with the non-treated sample (-12.7% and -13.1% per ODM, respectively). More complex additives with hetero- and homo-fermentative activity (Silasil Energy®) as well as enzymes (Sil-all 4 × 4®) or bacteria and yeasts (Microferm®) did effectively increase the biogas production per ODM (respectively with 11.8, 10.1 and 14.7%). Losses in ODM content were minor in all samples. These results might indicate that more divergent biological additives involving yeasts or enzymes during ensiling are preferred as maize preservation tools for anaerobic digestion instead of a spontaneous ensilage population or to add only homo- and hetero-fermentative strains.

Herein, contrary to designing suitable matrix to immobilize Te as cathodes, we develop a novel and complete different strategy to design S-doped Te nanorod cathodes for Li-Te batteries. S-doping can effectively induce the redistribution of electrons between low electronegative Te and high electronegative S to generate internal electrical fields, accelerating the transport kinetics of Li+ and electrons. Experimental results and density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that S-doping can efficiently lower the lithiation/delithiation energy barriers, significantly improve the redox reaction kinetics and mitigate the redox reaction polarization. More importantly, the DMSO-based electrolyte can significantly uplift the discharge voltage, promising a much higher energy density. Taking advantage of heteroatomic S doping, the optimal Te0.92S0.08 cathode without any carbonous matrix exhibits high volumetric capacity of 1615 mAh cm−3 over 100 cycles under a current density of 0.1C, a dramatic rate capacity of 562 mA h cm−3 at 2C and long cycling stability.

Based on the multi-regime flamelet (MRF) model proposed for low Mach number flows, a modified MRF model that applies to supersonic flow conditions has been developed. Taken a hydrogen-fueled model combustor as test case, the good agreement between the calculation and experiments was obtained. The distribution of weighting coefficient, which is defined based on the concept of combustion regime index, shows that the flow field in the supersonic combustor is partially-premixed. The premixed regime distributes in the backflow region, the shear layer and the boundary layer.

84907410919,7,Electricity demand of PHEVs operated by private households and commercial fleets: Effects of driving and charging behavior,Electric grid impact Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) charging,"The U.S. Department of Energy's Advanced Vehicle Testing Activity - conducted by the Idaho National Laboratory for the U.S. Department of Energy's Vehicle Technologies Program - in partnership with the University of California, Davis's Institute for Transportation Studies, has collected data from a fleet of plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) conversions, placed into diverse operating environments, to quantify the petroleum displacement potential of early PHEV models. This demonstration also provided an opportunity to assess the impact of PHEVs on the electric grid based on observed, rather than simulated, vehicle driving and charging behavior. This paper presents the electricity demand of PHEVs operating in undirected, real-world conditions. For personal-use vehicles on weekdays, peak power demand to charge the PHEVs and the period of greatest variability in demand across weekdays occurred during an evening peak that started around 4:00 p.m. and rose until 10:00 p.m. On weekends, peak demand also occurred at 10:00 p.m., but at lower magnitude than on weekdays because fewer vehicles were plugged-in and those that were typically had a higher battery state of charge.

After controlling for standard growth correlates, the empirical results show that countries that protect the economic rights of women experience higher real GDP per capita growth rates. Furthermore, after controlling for a country’s religious affiliation, the importance of religion to the lives of people living in a country had a negative influence on economic growth. Intensely held religious beliefs are strongly correlated with gender inequitable views. These attitudes might serve as an important channel through which these gender biases are institutionalized in economic practices and act to slow economic growth.","[TITLE] the many dimensions of gender equality and their impact on economic growth [KEYWORDS] economic growth education gender labor markets religion [ABSTRACT] this study explores the multidimensional nature of gender equality and its influence on economic growth across 64 countries from 2000–2011 using an endogenous growth model. after controlling for standard growth correlates, the empirical results show that countries that protect the economic rights of women experience higher real gdp per capita growth rates. furthermore, after controlling for a country’s religious affiliation, the importance of religion to the lives of people living in a country had a negative influence on economic growth. intensely held religious beliefs are strongly correlated with gender inequitable views. these attitudes might serve as an important channel through which these gender biases are institutionalized in economic practices and act to slow economic growth."

An Africa strategy for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The policy seeks to move away from the traditional basis of aid, towards two-way trade and investment links with targeted African partners that can produce mutual benefits for Ireland and key partner countries. The policy advocates the use of a 'whole of government' approach, with the dual objectives of promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and protecting the most vulnerable populations in key partner countries. Through an analysis of the Irish economic-development model, we outline the policies and institutions that were required at the nationstate level to attract capital investment in export platforms, and to ensure that the benefits were appropriated and distributed to the general population, and that the basic rights of the population were protected. We argue that technical support to key partner countries is required to support the development of such institutional structures as Ireland embarks on two-way trade and investment, and diverts Official Development Assistance to public-private partnerships that invest in African nation-states. Such institutions are also necessary to protect African nation-states from undesirable outcomes from EU and African Economic Partnership Agreements.","[TITLE] the challenges and opportunities presented by trade partnerships between africa and ireland [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] in this paper we examine the challenges and opportunities generated by ireland's strategic approach to trade as an instrument for international development, as outlined in the irish government's policy documents one world, one future-ireland's policy for international development and ireland and africa: our partnership with a changing continent. an africa strategy for the department of foreign affairs and trade. the policy seeks to move away from the traditional basis of aid, towards two-way trade and investment links with targeted african partners that can produce mutual benefits for ireland and key partner countries. the policy advocates the use of a 'whole of government' approach, with the dual objectives of promoting sustainable and inclusive economic growth, and protecting the most vulnerable populations in key partner countries. through an analysis of the irish economic-development model, we outline the policies and institutions that were required at the nationstate level to attract capital investment in export platforms, and to ensure that the benefits were appropriated and distributed to the general population, and that the basic rights of the population were protected. we argue that technical support to key partner countries is required to support the development of such institutional structures as ireland embarks on two-way trade and investment, and diverts official development assistance to public-private partnerships that invest in african nation-states. such institutions are also necessary to protect african nation-states from undesirable outcomes from eu and african economic partnership agreements."

85073706203,7,"A semi-empirical, electrochemistry-based model for Li-ion battery performance prediction over lifetime",Ageing mechanisms Li-ion battery Performance and lifetime prediction Semi-empirical model,"Predicting the performance of Li-ion batteries over lifetime is necessary for design and optimal operation of integrated energy systems, as electric vehicles and energy grids. For prediction purposes, several models have been suggested in the literature, with different levels of complexity and predictability. In particular, electrochemical models suffer of high computational costs, while empirical models are deprived of physical meaning. In the present work, a semi-empirical model is suggested, holding the computational efficiency of empirical approaches (low number of fitting parameters, low-order algebraic equations), while providing insights on the processes occurring in the battery during operation. The proposed model is successfully validated on experimental battery cycles: specifically, in conditions of capacity fade >20%, and dynamic cycling at different temperatures. A comparable performance to up-to-date empirical models is achieved both in terms of computational time, and correlation coefficient R2. In addition, analyzing the evolution of fitting parameters as a function of cycle number allows to identify the limiting processes in the overall battery degradation for all the protocols considered. The model suggested is thus suitable for implementation in system modelling, and it can be employed as an informative tool for improved design and operational strategies.","[TITLE] a semi-empirical, electrochemistry-based model for li-ion battery performance prediction over lifetime [KEYWORDS] ageing mechanisms li-ion battery performance and lifetime prediction semi-empirical model [ABSTRACT] predicting the performance of li-ion batteries over lifetime is necessary for design and optimal operation of integrated energy systems, as electric vehicles and energy grids. for prediction purposes, several models have been suggested in the literature, with different levels of complexity and predictability. in particular, electrochemical models suffer of high computational costs, while empirical models are deprived of physical meaning. in the present work, a semi-empirical model is suggested, holding the computational efficiency of empirical approaches (low number of fitting parameters, low-order algebraic equations), while providing insights on the processes occurring in the battery during operation. the proposed model is successfully validated on experimental battery cycles: specifically, in conditions of capacity fade >20%, and dynamic cycling at different temperatures. a comparable performance to up-to-date empirical models is achieved both in terms of computational time, and correlation coefficient r2. in addition, analyzing the evolution of fitting parameters as a function of cycle number allows to identify the limiting processes in the overall battery degradation for all the protocols considered. the model suggested is thus suitable for implementation in system modelling, and it can be employed as an informative tool for improved design and operational strategies."
