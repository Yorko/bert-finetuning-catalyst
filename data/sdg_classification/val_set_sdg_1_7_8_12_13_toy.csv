In their poignant and sometimes heartbreaking perceptions of their ‘biggest challenges,’ graduates vividly illustrate the negative implications of degree completion during the recession. Based on an analysis of both closed and open-ended survey data of Michigan's 2012 graduates, we find that women and first generation college graduates fare the worst in terms of their employment status, debt and income levels, and subjective assessments of job opportunities and financial stress. In contrast, men, especially those whose parents have at least a bachelor's degree, were more likely than their counterparts to report that their ‘biggest challenge’ since graduation was linked with making the transition into adult roles. Taken together, these findings suggest widespread difficulty after graduating from college during the Great Recession, and the ways in which these difficulties are linked with gender and class inequalities.","[TITLE] the transition from college to work during the great recession: employment, financial, and identity challenges [KEYWORDS] employment gender higher education recession social class young adulthood [ABSTRACT] this study examines the challenges that recent college graduates face in a hard-hit us region during the great recession. in their poignant and sometimes heartbreaking perceptions of their ‘biggest challenges,’ graduates vividly illustrate the negative implications of degree completion during the recession. based on an analysis of both closed and open-ended survey data of michigan's 2012 graduates, we find that women and first generation college graduates fare the worst in terms of their employment status, debt and income levels, and subjective assessments of job opportunities and financial stress. in contrast, men, especially those whose parents have at least a bachelor's degree, were more likely than their counterparts to report that their ‘biggest challenge’ since graduation was linked with making the transition into adult roles. taken together, these findings suggest widespread difficulty after graduating from college during the great recession, and the ways in which these difficulties are linked with gender and class inequalities."

It has been suggested that these entrepreneurs can function as important catalysts to larger-scale socioeconomic structural transformations toward sustainability. However, the actual mechanisms underlying such a role are empirically under-researched and theoretically underdeveloped. In this study we investigate the possible catalytic role of sustainability entrepreneurship in the equitable transition to a low-carbon economy. We do this by developing a co-evolutionary framework that links the interactive dynamics of change in technologies, institutions and business strategies, and use this framework to analyse an empirical case study of NativeEnergy, an innovative, for-profit, marketing and finance company launched in the context of the evolving US energy industry. The article concludes by assessing the more general lessons that may be drawn about the role of sustainability entrepreneurs as catalysts to socioeconomic structural transformations.","[TITLE] sustainability entrepreneurship and equitable transitions to a low-carbon economy [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] sustainability-driven entrepreneurs design ventures with the primary intention of contributing to improved environmental quality and social well-being in ways that are mutually supportive. it has been suggested that these entrepreneurs can function as important catalysts to larger-scale socioeconomic structural transformations toward sustainability. however, the actual mechanisms underlying such a role are empirically under-researched and theoretically underdeveloped. in this study we investigate the possible catalytic role of sustainability entrepreneurship in the equitable transition to a low-carbon economy. we do this by developing a co-evolutionary framework that links the interactive dynamics of change in technologies, institutions and business strategies, and use this framework to analyse an empirical case study of nativeenergy, an innovative, for-profit, marketing and finance company launched in the context of the evolving us energy industry. the article concludes by assessing the more general lessons that may be drawn about the role of sustainability entrepreneurs as catalysts to socioeconomic structural transformations."
84862919859,12,Determination of 41 polybrominated diphenyl ethers in soil using a pressurised solvent extraction and GC-NCI-MS method,E-waste recycling site GC-NCI-MS PBDEs PSE extraction Soil,"A rapid and reliable analytical method based on pressurised solvent extraction (PSE) and GC-NCI-MS was developed for the determination of 41 different PBDEs in soil. All PBDEs, including mono- to hepta-BDEs (sum of 39 congeners), one nona-BDE and deca-BDE, were efficiently extracted from soil samples using the extraction technology of PSE. The extract was then cleaned up on a florisil column. Satisfactory separation of 41 PBDE congeners was obtained on a 15-m DB-5MS capillary column, saving the use of another 30-m column specific for the separation of mono- to hepta-BDEs. PBDEs were identified and quantified by GC-MS in negative chemical ionisation (NCI) mode, and further confirmed in semi electron impact (SEI) mode when the ion source was also NCI. The method detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 0.03 ng g -1 dw for mono- to hepta-BDEs, 1.43 ng g -1 dw for the nona-BDE and 0.20 ng g -1 dw for deca-BDE. The applicability of the method was tested in soil samples collected from an e-waste recycling site at Guiyu. Twenty-one PBDEs (mono- to deca-) were detected, and eighteen congeners were quantified. The concentration range of PBDEs was 0.78-436 ng g -1 dw. BDE-47, BDE-99, BDE-153, BDE-183, BDE-206 and BDE-209 were the dominant congeners, and BDE-209 accounted for 62% of the total PBDEs. The congener profiles of PBDEs in soil samples were similar to those in three commercial PBDE products (Penta-, Octa- and Deca-BDE), and Deca-BDE product was the most important contributor. © 2011 Taylor & Francis.","[TITLE] determination of 41 polybrominated diphenyl ethers in soil using a pressurised solvent extraction and gc-nci-ms method [KEYWORDS] e-waste recycling site gc-nci-ms pbdes pse extraction soil [ABSTRACT] a rapid and reliable analytical method based on pressurised solvent extraction (pse) and gc-nci-ms was developed for the determination of 41 different pbdes in soil. all pbdes, including mono- to hepta-bdes (sum of 39 congeners), one nona-bde and deca-bde, were efficiently extracted from soil samples using the extraction technology of pse. the extract was then cleaned up on a florisil column. satisfactory separation of 41 pbde congeners was obtained on a 15-m db-5ms capillary column, saving the use of another 30-m column specific for the separation of mono- to hepta-bdes. pbdes were identified and quantified by gc-ms in negative chemical ionisation (nci) mode, and further confirmed in semi electron impact (sei) mode when the ion source was also nci. the method detection limits ranged from 0.01 to 0.03 ng g -1 dw for mono- to hepta-bdes, 1.43 ng g -1 dw for the nona-bde and 0.20 ng g -1 dw for deca-bde. the applicability of the method was tested in soil samples collected from an e-waste recycling site at guiyu. twenty-one pbdes (mono- to deca-) were detected, and eighteen congeners were quantified. the concentration range of pbdes was 0.78-436 ng g -1 dw. bde-47, bde-99, bde-153, bde-183, bde-206 and bde-209 were the dominant congeners, and bde-209 accounted for 62% of the total pbdes. the congener profiles of pbdes in soil samples were similar to those in three commercial pbde products (penta-, octa- and deca-bde), and deca-bde product was the most important contributor. © 2011 taylor & francis."

Current rates of biodiversity loss need to be curbed by using effective interventions and decision-making that again require timely information. Undertaking a community sustainability assessment to generate and structure this information for grassroots levels is critical for decision-making and actions. This paper presents insights from a community sustainability assessment initiative undertaken in Lesotho within a trans-boundary project area known as the Maloti-Drakensberg Transfrontier Project. A qualitative case study approach was employed through a combination of several data collection techniques, including a literature review, field observations, key informant interviews, group discussions and key informant workshops. Study participants consisted of members of the community conservation forums from three districts that had been established by the project. Regarding progress towards the sustainability of biodiversity in the study area, the results indicated that current practices are unsustainable, more from the point of view of the socio-ecological components than the socio-cultural and spiritual or the socio-economic components.

84929305646,12,A modular gene targeting system for sequential transgene stacking in plants,Corn Gene targeting Plants Transgene stacking Zinc finger nuclease,"A modular, selection-based method was developed for site-specific integration of transgenes into a genomic locus to create multigene stacks. High-frequency gene targeting was obtained using zinc finger nuclease (ZFN)-mediated double-strand break (DSB) formation at a pre-defined target genomic location using a unique intron directly downstream of a promoter driving a selectable marker gene to facilitate homology between target and donor sequences. In this system, only insertion into the target locus leads to a functional selectable marker, and regeneration from random insertions of the promoterless donor construct are reduced on selection media. A new stack of transgenes can potentially be loaded with each successive cycle of gene targeting by exchanging the selectable marker gene using the intron homology. This system was tested in maize using the pat selectable marker gene, whereby up to 30% of the plants regenerated on Bialaphos-containing medium were observed to have the donor construct integrated into the target locus. Unlike previous gene targeting methods that utilize defective or partial genes for selecting targeted events, the present method exchanges fully functional genes with every cycle of targeting, thereby allowing the recycling of selectable marker genes, hypothetically for multiple generations of gene targeting.","[TITLE] a modular gene targeting system for sequential transgene stacking in plants [KEYWORDS] corn gene targeting plants transgene stacking zinc finger nuclease [ABSTRACT] a modular, selection-based method was developed for site-specific integration of transgenes into a genomic locus to create multigene stacks. high-frequency gene targeting was obtained using zinc finger nuclease (zfn)-mediated double-strand break (dsb) formation at a pre-defined target genomic location using a unique intron directly downstream of a promoter driving a selectable marker gene to facilitate homology between target and donor sequences. in this system, only insertion into the target locus leads to a functional selectable marker, and regeneration from random insertions of the promoterless donor construct are reduced on selection media. a new stack of transgenes can potentially be loaded with each successive cycle of gene targeting by exchanging the selectable marker gene using the intron homology. this system was tested in maize using the pat selectable marker gene, whereby up to 30% of the plants regenerated on bialaphos-containing medium were observed to have the donor construct integrated into the target locus. unlike previous gene targeting methods that utilize defective or partial genes for selecting targeted events, the present method exchanges fully functional genes with every cycle of targeting, thereby allowing the recycling of selectable marker genes, hypothetically for multiple generations of gene targeting."

In this paper, we develop a dynamic spatial simulation model of coastal land and housing markets and study the competing influences of storm risks and amenities. The model is parameterized to the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, where hurricanes occur relatively infrequently, and then used to assess how spatial patterns of development would change if storm frequency increases. Results show that spatial patterns change very little—approximately 45 percent of the land area in the coastal region is developed by the final model period in both the baseline and high storm risk scenarios and the coast sees more development than inland areas in all scenarios. The countervailing coastal amenity matters more with the percent developed in the coastal region varying between 29 and 51 percent depending on the scenario. Perhaps more importantly, we find that heterogeneous households sort differently on the landscape in our different scenarios. When storms are more frequent, average land prices near the coast are 1.2–11.8 percent lower, which leads to households with lower average incomes locating there. The results highlight the difficulty policymakers may have in altering private land and housing market outcomes to reduce storm costs in coastal regions.","[TITLE] modeling coastal land and housing markets: understanding the competing influences of amenities and storm risks [KEYWORDS] agent-based model climate change coastal development hurricanes [ABSTRACT] the costs from coastal storms and hurricanes are expected to increase with climate change yet populations in coastal areas continue to grow. in this paper, we develop a dynamic spatial simulation model of coastal land and housing markets and study the competing influences of storm risks and amenities. the model is parameterized to the mid-atlantic region of the united states, where hurricanes occur relatively infrequently, and then used to assess how spatial patterns of development would change if storm frequency increases. results show that spatial patterns change very little—approximately 45 percent of the land area in the coastal region is developed by the final model period in both the baseline and high storm risk scenarios and the coast sees more development than inland areas in all scenarios. the countervailing coastal amenity matters more with the percent developed in the coastal region varying between 29 and 51 percent depending on the scenario. perhaps more importantly, we find that heterogeneous households sort differently on the landscape in our different scenarios. when storms are more frequent, average land prices near the coast are 1.2–11.8 percent lower, which leads to households with lower average incomes locating there. the results highlight the difficulty policymakers may have in altering private land and housing market outcomes to reduce storm costs in coastal regions."

We propose that WISEs are an expression of a neoliberal welfare logic that challenges social rights by emphasizing market solutions to social needs and by devolving and privatizing social services to the local level and the private sector. We show that as a hybrid organizational form, WISEs must balance between two conflicting institutional logics: market and social services. Our research demonstrates that when the WISEs are dominated by a market logic, they commodify their clients as production workers. We suggest that WISEs, as a hybrid organizational form, contribute to the neoliberal project of blurring the boundaries between the market and the welfare state.","[TITLE] social enterprises as an embodiment of a neoliberal welfare logic [KEYWORDS] hybridity neoliberalism social enterprise work integration [ABSTRACT] we explore the rise of social enterprises, particularly, work integration social enterprises (wises), their particular hybrid organizational form, and their impact on their clients. we propose that wises are an expression of a neoliberal welfare logic that challenges social rights by emphasizing market solutions to social needs and by devolving and privatizing social services to the local level and the private sector. we show that as a hybrid organizational form, wises must balance between two conflicting institutional logics: market and social services. our research demonstrates that when the wises are dominated by a market logic, they commodify their clients as production workers. we suggest that wises, as a hybrid organizational form, contribute to the neoliberal project of blurring the boundaries between the market and the welfare state."

The experimental results showed that reducing the olefin content had little impact on brake power, while it obviously increased brake-specific fuel consumption and decreased brake thermal efficiency at low and medium speeds. In addition, lower exhaust gas temperatures were observed at low speeds. The comparative results indicated that reducing the olefin content decreased CO emissions by -5.8 to 22.8%, but slightly increased (less than 5%) CO2 emissions. Likewise, total hydrocarbon emissions decreased, while NOx emissions also decreased by 5-15% under most of the operating conditions. Most importantly, great reductions in particle mass concentrations and particle number emissions were observed when lower olefin content gasoline was used, with decreases of up to 87.4 and 95.8%, respectively. Moreover, particle mass and particle number changes suggest that a lower olefin content facilitates the formation of larger soot particles. Therefore, although reducing the olefin content is disadvantageous to engine performance, it markedly reduces CO, total hydrocarbon, NOx, particle mass, and particle number emissions, in line with the latest national emission regulations.","[TITLE] comparative effects of olefin content on the performance and emissions of a modern gdi engine [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] the effects of different olefin contents in fuel (nominally 8.2 and 17.2% in volume) on the performance and exhaust emissions of a modern gasoline direct injection engine at speeds of 1500, 3500, and 5000 rpm under 10, 25, 50, 75, and 100% engine loads were investigated. the experimental results showed that reducing the olefin content had little impact on brake power, while it obviously increased brake-specific fuel consumption and decreased brake thermal efficiency at low and medium speeds. in addition, lower exhaust gas temperatures were observed at low speeds. the comparative results indicated that reducing the olefin content decreased co emissions by -5.8 to 22.8%, but slightly increased (less than 5%) co2 emissions. likewise, total hydrocarbon emissions decreased, while nox emissions also decreased by 5-15% under most of the operating conditions. most importantly, great reductions in particle mass concentrations and particle number emissions were observed when lower olefin content gasoline was used, with decreases of up to 87.4 and 95.8%, respectively. moreover, particle mass and particle number changes suggest that a lower olefin content facilitates the formation of larger soot particles. therefore, although reducing the olefin content is disadvantageous to engine performance, it markedly reduces co, total hydrocarbon, nox, particle mass, and particle number emissions, in line with the latest national emission regulations."

However, few studies have investigated how this rhizosphere effect depends on the soil conditions, and never for trees. Contrary to annual plants, trees need decades to grow and strongly depend on the access and recycling of soil nutrients and water. In this context, we aimed at understanding if contrasted soil types impact the taxonomy and functions of bacterial communities inhabiting beech rhizosphere. To test this hypothesis, we considered the natural toposequence of Montiers, which is characterized by a same land cover dominated by beech (Fagus sylvatica) trees of the same age, growing under the same climatic conditions and under the same forestry practices.

85027853035,13,Factors Affecting CO2-EOR in Shale-Oil Reservoirs: Numerical Simulation Study and Pilot Tests,missing,"Shale oil reservoirs such as Bakken, Niobrara, and Eagle Ford have become the main target for oil and gas investors as conventional formations started to be depleted and diminished in number. These unconventional plays have a huge oil potential; however, the predicted primary oil recovery is still low as an average of 7.5%. Injecting carbon dioxide (CO2) to enhance oil recovery in these poor-quality formations is still a debatable issue among investigators. In this study, three steps of research have been integrated to investigate the parameters that control the success of CO2 huff-n-puff process in the field scale of shale oil reservoirs. First, a numerical simulation study was conducted to upscale the reported experimental studies outcomes to the field conditions. The second step was to validate these numerical models with the field data from some of CO2-EOR pilots, which were performed in Bakken formation, in North Dakota and Montana regions. Finally, statistical methods for Design of Experiments (DOE) have been used to rank the most important parameters affecting CO2-EOR performance in these unconventional reservoirs. The Design of Experiments approved that the intensity of natural fractures (the number of natural fractures per length unit in each direction, I-direction, J-direction, and K-direction) and the conductivity of oil pathways (the average conductivity for the entire oil molecules path, from its storage (matrix) to the wellbore) are the two main factors controlling CO2-EOR success in shale oil reservoirs. However, the fracture intensity has a positive effect on CO2-EOR, while the later has a negative effect. Furthermore, this study found that the porosity and the permeability of natural fractures in shale reservoirs are clearly changeable with the production time, which, in turn, led to a clear gap between CO2 performances in the lab conditions versus what happened in the field pilots. This work reported that the molecular diffusion mechanism is the key mechanism for CO2 to enhance oil recovery in shale oil reservoirs. However, the conditions of the candidate field and the production well criteria can enhance or downgrade this mechanism in the field scale.

Moreover, general guidelines have been provided from this work to perform successful CO2 projects in these complex plays. Finally, this Article provides a thorough idea about how CO2 performance is different between the field scale of shale oil reservoirs and the lab-scale conditions.","[TITLE] factors affecting co2-eor in shale-oil reservoirs: numerical simulation study and pilot tests [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] shale oil reservoirs such as bakken, niobrara, and eagle ford have become the main target for oil and gas investors as conventional formations started to be depleted and diminished in number. these unconventional plays have a huge oil potential; however, the predicted primary oil recovery is still low as an average of 7.5%. injecting carbon dioxide (co2) to enhance oil recovery in these poor-quality formations is still a debatable issue among investigators. in this study, three steps of research have been integrated to investigate the parameters that control the success of co2 huff-n-puff process in the field scale of shale oil reservoirs. first, a numerical simulation study was conducted to upscale the reported experimental studies outcomes to the field conditions. the second step was to validate these numerical models with the field data from some of co2-eor pilots, which were performed in bakken formation, in north dakota and montana regions. finally, statistical methods for design of experiments (doe) have been used to rank the most important parameters affecting co2-eor performance in these unconventional reservoirs. the design of experiments approved that the intensity of natural fractures (the number of natural fractures per length unit in each direction, i-direction, j-direction, and k-direction) and the conductivity of oil pathways (the average conductivity for the entire oil molecules path, from its storage (matrix) to the wellbore) are the two main factors controlling co2-eor success in shale oil reservoirs. however, the fracture intensity has a positive effect on co2-eor, while the later has a negative effect. furthermore, this study found that the porosity and the permeability of natural fractures in shale reservoirs are clearly changeable with the production time, which, in turn, led to a clear gap between co2 performances in the lab conditions versus what happened in the field pilots. this work reported that the molecular diffusion mechanism is the key mechanism for co2 to enhance oil recovery in shale oil reservoirs. however, the conditions of the candidate field and the production well criteria can enhance or downgrade this mechanism in the field scale. accordingly, the operating parameters for managing co2-eor huff-n-puff process should be tuned according to the candidate reservoir and well conditions. moreover, general guidelines have been provided from this work to perform successful co2 projects in these complex plays. finally, this article provides a thorough idea about how co2 performance is different between the field scale of shale oil reservoirs and the lab-scale conditions."
37929488,13,The response of the Antarctic Oscillation to increasing and stabilized atmospheric CO2,missing,"Recent results from greenhouse warming experiments, most of which follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) IS92a scenario, have shown that under increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration, the Antarctic Oscillation (AAO) exhibits a positive trend. However, its response during the subsequent CO2 stabilization period has not been explored. In this study, it is shown that the upward trend of the AAO reverses during such a stabilization period. This evolution of an upward trend and a subsequent reversal is present in each ensemble of three greenhouse simulations using three versions of the CSIRO Mark 2 coupled climate model. The evolution is shown to be linked with that of surface temperature, which also displays a corresponding trend and reversal, incorporating the well-known feature of interhemispheric warming asymmetry with smaller warming in the Southern Hemisphere (smaller as latitude increases) than that in the Northern Hemisphere during the transient period, and vice versa during the stabilization period. These results indicate that once CO2 concentration stabilizes, reversal of the AAO trend established during the transient period is likely to be a robust feature, as it is underpinned by the likelihood that latitudinal warming differences will reduce or disappear. The implication is that climatic impacts associated with the AAO trend during the transient period may be reversible if CO2 stabilization is achieved.","[TITLE] the response of the antarctic oscillation to increasing and stabilized atmospheric co2 [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] recent results from greenhouse warming experiments, most of which follow the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc) is92a scenario, have shown that under increasing atmospheric co2 concentration, the antarctic oscillation (aao) exhibits a positive trend. however, its response during the subsequent co2 stabilization period has not been explored. in this study, it is shown that the upward trend of the aao reverses during such a stabilization period. this evolution of an upward trend and a subsequent reversal is present in each ensemble of three greenhouse simulations using three versions of the csiro mark 2 coupled climate model. the evolution is shown to be linked with that of surface temperature, which also displays a corresponding trend and reversal, incorporating the well-known feature of interhemispheric warming asymmetry with smaller warming in the southern hemisphere (smaller as latitude increases) than that in the northern hemisphere during the transient period, and vice versa during the stabilization period. these results indicate that once co2 concentration stabilizes, reversal of the aao trend established during the transient period is likely to be a robust feature, as it is underpinned by the likelihood that latitudinal warming differences will reduce or disappear. the implication is that climatic impacts associated with the aao trend during the transient period may be reversible if co2 stabilization is achieved."

However, developing countries lack these infrastructures and are in need of sustainable, decentralized and economically viable solutions for the disposal of their urban wastewaters. In addition to this, there are situations where the demands of conservation of natural spaces do not allow intensive constructive procedures and which force the implementation of sanitary engineering with less environmental impact. We present the Ecological Wastewater Sewer (EWS), an ecological urban sewerage system that simultaneously transports wastewater and improves its quality. This innovative technology is an alternative to conventional sanitation piping that has minimal environmental impact. It is based on a successful previous work for the improvement of artificial wetlands in a pilot scheme and at full-scale on a test site. The EWS is a channel-shaped device that relies on the application of two key developments: a carefully designed cornered stones layout, and the creation of a natural aeration system. This way, it acts as a separating sewage system that guarantees the presence of a chamber of circulating air within the transportation unit, favouring permanent aerobic conditions in the upper levels of the mass of wastewater. Furthermore, its capacity to settle suspended solids allows the EWS to be used as a sedimentor in water purification processes. A real-life application of this system proved successful in the sanitation of a district of Managua (Nicaragua). Working with a 100-metre-long street of 20 one-story houses, the system is reported to still be in full operating order after six years. The conclusions and results drawn from its monitoring are meticulously explained in our paper, as well as the recommendations & guidelines for the design of more EWS units, with aim to the popularization of this affordable, efficient and green approach to wastewater sanitation.","[TITLE] ecologically designed sanitary sewer based on constructed wetlands technology - case study in managua (nicaragua) [KEYWORDS] aeration anaerobic biofilm processes clogging constructed wetland ecological-sewerage wastewater management [ABSTRACT] in developed countries the sanitation and treatment of urban wastewater is well sustained and technically solved by means of conventional pipe networks and subsequent centralized treatments. however, developing countries lack these infrastructures and are in need of sustainable, decentralized and economically viable solutions for the disposal of their urban wastewaters. in addition to this, there are situations where the demands of conservation of natural spaces do not allow intensive constructive procedures and which force the implementation of sanitary engineering with less environmental impact. we present the ecological wastewater sewer (ews), an ecological urban sewerage system that simultaneously transports wastewater and improves its quality. this innovative technology is an alternative to conventional sanitation piping that has minimal environmental impact. it is based on a successful previous work for the improvement of artificial wetlands in a pilot scheme and at full-scale on a test site. the ews is a channel-shaped device that relies on the application of two key developments: a carefully designed cornered stones layout, and the creation of a natural aeration system. this way, it acts as a separating sewage system that guarantees the presence of a chamber of circulating air within the transportation unit, favouring permanent aerobic conditions in the upper levels of the mass of wastewater. furthermore, its capacity to settle suspended solids allows the ews to be used as a sedimentor in water purification processes. a real-life application of this system proved successful in the sanitation of a district of managua (nicaragua). working with a 100-metre-long street of 20 one-story houses, the system is reported to still be in full operating order after six years. the conclusions and results drawn from its monitoring are meticulously explained in our paper, as well as the recommendations & guidelines for the design of more ews units, with aim to the popularization of this affordable, efficient and green approach to wastewater sanitation."

Therefore, this article attempts to explore the impacts of CC on oil palm production in Malaysia and provides mitigation and adaptation strategies towards reducing such impacts. The multiple regression analysis is applied to assess the impacts of CC on oil palm production by using time series data in the period of 1980 to 2010. A negative and significant relationship is found between annual average temperature and oil palm production. If temperature rises by 1 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C, and 4 °C, production of oil palm can decrease from a range of 10 to 41%. This article has also found a negative impact of sea level rise (SLR) on oil palm production. Findings reveal that if areas under oil palm production decrease by 2%, 4%, and 8% due to SLR of 0.5, 1, and 2 m, oil palm production can decrease by 1.98%, 3.96%, and 7.92%, respectively, indicating that CC has a significant impact on the reduction of oil palm production in Malaysia, ultimately affecting the sustainability of oil palm sector in Malaysia. Finally, this study suggests to practice appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies, including promotion and development of climate resilient varieties, soil and water conservation, afforestation, insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms, emission reduction technology, protection of coastal flooding for reducing the impacts of CC on oil palm production.","[TITLE] impacts of climate change on oil palm production in malaysia [KEYWORDS] adaptation climate change impacts malaysia mitigation oil palm production [ABSTRACT] studies reveal that climate change (cc) has higher negative impacts on agricultural production than positive impacts. therefore, this article attempts to explore the impacts of cc on oil palm production in malaysia and provides mitigation and adaptation strategies towards reducing such impacts. the multiple regression analysis is applied to assess the impacts of cc on oil palm production by using time series data in the period of 1980 to 2010. a negative and significant relationship is found between annual average temperature and oil palm production. if temperature rises by 1 °c, 2 °c, 3 °c, and 4 °c, production of oil palm can decrease from a range of 10 to 41%. this article has also found a negative impact of sea level rise (slr) on oil palm production. findings reveal that if areas under oil palm production decrease by 2%, 4%, and 8% due to slr of 0.5, 1, and 2 m, oil palm production can decrease by 1.98%, 3.96%, and 7.92%, respectively, indicating that cc has a significant impact on the reduction of oil palm production in malaysia, ultimately affecting the sustainability of oil palm sector in malaysia. finally, this study suggests to practice appropriate mitigation and adaptation strategies, including promotion and development of climate resilient varieties, soil and water conservation, afforestation, insurance and other risk transfer mechanisms, emission reduction technology, protection of coastal flooding for reducing the impacts of cc on oil palm production."
348144813,8,NIOSH AutoROPS Latch and Release Mechanism: Second Generation,missing,"Approximately 132 agricultural tractor overturn fatalities occur per year (Myers and Snyder, 1993). The use of rollover protective structures on farm tractors (ROPS), along with operator seat belt use, is the best known method for preventing these fatalities. One impediment to universal ROPS use, however, is low clearance situations, such as orchards and animal confinement buildings. To address the need for ROPS that are easily adapted to low clearance situations, the Division of Safety Research (DSR), National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), developed a prototype automatically deploying, telescoping ROPS (AutoROPS). The NIOSH AutoROPS consists of two subsystems. The first is a retractable ROPS that is normally mounted to the tractor axle and latched in its lowered position for day-to-day use. The second subsystem is a sensor that monitors the operating angle and rate of roll on two axes of the tractor. If an overturn condition is detected by the sensor, the retracted ROPS will deploy and lock in the full upright position before ground contact. This paper discusses the second generation design of the latch and release mechanism (LRM) for the NIOSH AutoROPS and recommends key areas for future surveillance and design research to best facilitate reduction in farm rollover fatalities.","[TITLE] niosh autorops latch and release mechanism: second generation [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] approximately 132 agricultural tractor overturn fatalities occur per year (myers and snyder, 1993). the use of rollover protective structures on farm tractors (rops), along with operator seat belt use, is the best known method for preventing these fatalities. one impediment to universal rops use, however, is low clearance situations, such as orchards and animal confinement buildings. to address the need for rops that are easily adapted to low clearance situations, the division of safety research (dsr), national institute for occupational safety and health (niosh), developed a prototype automatically deploying, telescoping rops (autorops). the niosh autorops consists of two subsystems. the first is a retractable rops that is normally mounted to the tractor axle and latched in its lowered position for day-to-day use. the second subsystem is a sensor that monitors the operating angle and rate of roll on two axes of the tractor. if an overturn condition is detected by the sensor, the retracted rops will deploy and lock in the full upright position before ground contact. this paper discusses the second generation design of the latch and release mechanism (lrm) for the niosh autorops and recommends key areas for future surveillance and design research to best facilitate reduction in farm rollover fatalities."

We present the first constant-factor approximation algorithm for the minimum-weight dominating set problem in unit disk graphs, a problem motivated by applications in wireless ad-hoc networks. The algorithm is obtained in two steps: First, the problem is reduced to the problem of covering a set of points located in a small square using a minimum-weight set of unit disks.

Design/methodology/approach: This study constructs a mixed duopoly model wherein one domestic public firm competes with a foreign firm and investigates the influence of economic governance investment on the domestic government’s optimal degree of privatization choice and the foreign firm’s entry mode choice. Findings: This study shows that (1) better economic governance enhances the effect of privatization on output, thus resulting in a lower degree of privatization; (2) the optimal privatization policy of the domestic government is partial privatization irrespective of the foreign firm’s entry mode choice; (3) with optimal investment by the domestic government on economic governance, the optimal degree of privatization is higher under FDI than export, and the host-country welfare is also higher under FDI. In particular, this study demonstrates that better economic governance decreases the threshold of the degree of privatization when the foreign firm switches from export to FDI, implying that better economic governance stimulates the foreign firm to undertake FDI in the host country.

Restrictive policies may lead some individuals to choose to not travel to otherwise useful or enjoyable activities. This paper therefore explores what factors drive the probability of ‘not travel’ as a behavioural response to restrictive policies.

Therefore, our objective is to synthesize knowledge about natural big sagebrush regeneration. We identified and characterized the controls of big sagebrush seed production, germination, and establishment. The largest knowledge gaps and associated research needs include quiescence and dormancy of embryos and seedlings; variation in seed production and germination percentages; wet-thermal time model of germination; responses to frost events (including freezing/thawing of soils), CO2 concentration, and nutrients in combination with water availability; suitability of microsite vs. site conditions; competitive ability as well as seedling growth responses; and differences among subspecies and ecoregions. Potential impacts of climate change on big sagebrush regeneration could include that temperature increases may not have a large direct influence on regeneration due to the broad temperature optimum for regeneration, whereas indirect effects could include selection for populations with less stringent seed dormancy. Drier conditions will have direct negative effects on germination and seedling survival and could also lead to lighter seeds, which lowers germination success further. The short seed dispersal distance of big sagebrush may limit its tracking of suitable climate; whereas, the low competitive ability of big sagebrush seedlings may limit successful competition with species that track climate.

84930900733,8,Legal thoughts on how to merge trade facilitation and safety & security,missing,"Trade facilitation, understood as the simplification, standardisation and harmonisation of procedures and associated information flows required to move goods from seller to buyer and to make payment, has a lot to do with security of the global trade supply chain. Different international bodies interested in trade matters have come up with various rules, regulations, guidelines and other instruments intended to enhance trade facilitation and safety and security. This multiplicity of regulations causes some duplication and redundancies which may ultimately complicate the implementation of trade facilitation and supply chain security measures. As a solution, this paper explores the possibility of merging trade facilitation and safety and security by means of a single binding agreement under the auspices of either the World Trade Organization (WTO) or the World Customs Organization (WCO). Cognizant of the recently concluded Agreement on Trade Facilitation (WTO 2013d, WT/MIN(13)/36, WT/L/911), we further explore how the WCO can use its expertise and tools in this field to gradually enrich the Agreement in content, implementation and administration. This is in conformity with the 'Dublin Resolution' of the WCO Policy Commission (WCO 2013) which re-emphasised the centrality of the WCO in the implementation and administration of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation. The preference for a single binding agreement is based on the contention that 'hard law' (as opposed to 'soft law') is more likely to be effective particularly with regard to the implementation of trade facilitation and security-related provisions. And this is because 'hard law' tends to increase states' commitment to international agreements, can be self-executing or require domestic legal enactment, and foresees dispute settlement mechanisms which aid enforcement. By comparing the various trade facilitation and safety and security instruments under the WCO, particularly the Revised Kyoto Convention and the SAFE Framework, it is evidenced that trade facilitation and supply chain security are just different sides of the same coin. In other words, the trade facilitation principles and standards contained in the Revised Kyoto Convention are the basis of the safety and security provisions. Moreover, it is shown that some provisions of the SAFE Framework are similar in content to those of the Revised Kyoto Convention. It is therefore argued that these two instruments would need to be merged as an all-encompassing agreement under the auspices of the WCO. For better implementation, however, this should concurrently go with the institution of an effective dispute settlement system within the WCO. The WTO Agreement on Trade Facilitation is also discussed and it is observed that it falls short on adequately addressing the safety and security issues-which issues have a strong impact on trade facilitation. Thus, as a way forward, it is suggested that the WCO needs to make good use of Article 13 (especially paragraphs 1.5. and 1.6) of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation. By using its expertise and different tools for trade facilitation, the WCO can certainly influence the implementation and administration of the Agreement on Trade Facilitation. The periodical reviews of the Agreement as per Article 13, paragraph 1.6 may, for instance, be a good medium through which the idea of a substantial merging of trade facilitation and safety and security can be introduced.","[TITLE] legal thoughts on how to merge trade facilitation and safety & security [KEYWORDS] missing [ABSTRACT] trade facilitation, understood as the simplification, standardisation and harmonisation of procedures and associated information flows required to move goods from seller to buyer and to make payment, has a lot to do with security of the global trade supply chain. different international bodies interested in trade matters have come up with various rules, regulations, guidelines and other instruments intended to enhance trade facilitation and safety and security. this multiplicity of regulations causes some duplication and redundancies which may ultimately complicate the implementation of trade facilitation and supply chain security measures. as a solution, this paper explores the possibility of merging trade facilitation and safety and security by means of a single binding agreement under the auspices of either the world trade organization (wto) or the world customs organization (wco). cognizant of the recently concluded agreement on trade facilitation (wto 2013d, wt/min(13)/36, wt/l/911), we further explore how the wco can use its expertise and tools in this field to gradually enrich the agreement in content, implementation and administration. this is in conformity with the 'dublin resolution' of the wco policy commission (wco 2013) which re-emphasised the centrality of the wco in the implementation and administration of the agreement on trade facilitation. the preference for a single binding agreement is based on the contention that 'hard law' (as opposed to 'soft law') is more likely to be effective particularly with regard to the implementation of trade facilitation and security-related provisions. and this is because 'hard law' tends to increase states' commitment to international agreements, can be self-executing or require domestic legal enactment, and foresees dispute settlement mechanisms which aid enforcement. by comparing the various trade facilitation and safety and security instruments under the wco, particularly the revised kyoto convention and the safe framework, it is evidenced that trade facilitation and supply chain security are just different sides of the same coin. in other words, the trade facilitation principles and standards contained in the revised kyoto convention are the basis of the safety and security provisions. moreover, it is shown that some provisions of the safe framework are similar in content to those of the revised kyoto convention. it is therefore argued that these two instruments would need to be merged as an all-encompassing agreement under the auspices of the wco. for better implementation, however, this should concurrently go with the institution of an effective dispute settlement system within the wco. the wto agreement on trade facilitation is also discussed and it is observed that it falls short on adequately addressing the safety and security issues-which issues have a strong impact on trade facilitation. thus, as a way forward, it is suggested that the wco needs to make good use of article 13 (especially paragraphs 1.5. and 1.6) of the agreement on trade facilitation. by using its expertise and different tools for trade facilitation, the wco can certainly influence the implementation and administration of the agreement on trade facilitation. the periodical reviews of the agreement as per article 13, paragraph 1.6 may, for instance, be a good medium through which the idea of a substantial merging of trade facilitation and safety and security can be introduced."

85019935545,13,"The origin of shallow-buried natural gas in Sanhecun sag, Jiyang depression",Biodegradation Isotopic composition Jiyang depression Natural gas origin Sanhecun sag Secondary microbial gas,"Based on comprehensive analysis of the natural gas component, carbon and hydrogen isotope composition of the natural gas and associated oil saturated hydrocarbon chromatography of oil samples collected in Sanhecun sag, Jiyang depression, the geochemical characteristics and formation mechanism of shallow gas were studied. It is considered that the shallow gas in Sanhecun sag is typical secondary microbial gas. It is the mixture of newly generated secondary biogenic gas from biodegradation of thermal oil/gas and residual thermal gas. It seems that CO2 reduction with hydrogen dominates the methanogenic process. The results show that the natural gas is basically methane with relatively high dryness (C1/C1+>0.931). Carbon isotope value of methane shows a wide variation (δ13C1 from -50.03‰ to -39.03‰) and decreases with the increase of the hydrogen isotope value. There is a low content of heavy hydrocarbon and the carbon isotope values are generally higher (δ13C2 from -33.62‰ to -19.72‰, δ13C3 from -29.27‰ to -7.64‰, δ13n-C4 from -26.28‰ to -15.63‰). Carbon isotope value of CO2 is abnormally positive (δ13CCO2 from 2. 82‰ to 17. 69‰). The complicated characteristics of gas component and isotope composition of shallow gases can be explained by various sequential biodegradation, carbon dioxide reduction and mixing process. The secondary microbial gas has a very important implication for biodegraded heavy oil and thus the undiscovered heavy oil under the discovered shallow gas will be the target in the future exploration.","[TITLE] the origin of shallow-buried natural gas in sanhecun sag, jiyang depression [KEYWORDS] biodegradation isotopic composition jiyang depression natural gas origin sanhecun sag secondary microbial gas [ABSTRACT] based on comprehensive analysis of the natural gas component, carbon and hydrogen isotope composition of the natural gas and associated oil saturated hydrocarbon chromatography of oil samples collected in sanhecun sag, jiyang depression, the geochemical characteristics and formation mechanism of shallow gas were studied. it is considered that the shallow gas in sanhecun sag is typical secondary microbial gas. it is the mixture of newly generated secondary biogenic gas from biodegradation of thermal oil/gas and residual thermal gas. it seems that co2 reduction with hydrogen dominates the methanogenic process. the results show that the natural gas is basically methane with relatively high dryness (c1/c1+>0.931). carbon isotope value of methane shows a wide variation (δ13c1 from -50.03‰ to -39.03‰) and decreases with the increase of the hydrogen isotope value. there is a low content of heavy hydrocarbon and the carbon isotope values are generally higher (δ13c2 from -33.62‰ to -19.72‰, δ13c3 from -29.27‰ to -7.64‰, δ13n-c4 from -26.28‰ to -15.63‰). carbon isotope value of co2 is abnormally positive (δ13cco2 from 2. 82‰ to 17. 69‰). the complicated characteristics of gas component and isotope composition of shallow gases can be explained by various sequential biodegradation, carbon dioxide reduction and mixing process. the secondary microbial gas has a very important implication for biodegraded heavy oil and thus the undiscovered heavy oil under the discovered shallow gas will be the target in the future exploration."
80052021573,7,Genome-scale metabolic network modeling results in minimal interventions that cooperatively force carbon flux towards malonyl-CoA,Escherichia coli Flavonoids Malonyl-CoA Metabolic network modeling OptForce Synergistic effect,"Malonyl-coenzyme A is an important precursor metabolite for the biosynthesis of polyketides, flavonoids and biofuels. However, malonyl-CoA naturally synthesized in microorganisms is consumed for the production of fatty acids and phospholipids leaving only a small amount available for the production of other metabolic targets in recombinant biosynthesis. Here we present an integrated computational and experimental approach aimed at improving the intracellular availability of malonyl-CoA in Escherichia coli. We used a customized version of the recently developed OptForce methodology to predict a minimal set of genetic interventions that guarantee a prespecified yield of malonyl-CoA in E. coli strain BL21 Star™. In order to validate the model predictions, we have successfully constructed an E. coli recombinant strain that exhibits a 4-fold increase in the levels of intracellular malonyl-CoA compared to the wild type strain. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this E. coli strain for the production of plant-specific secondary metabolites naringenin (474. mg/L) with the highest yield ever achieved in a lab-scale fermentation process. Combined effect of the genetic interventions was found to be synergistic based on a developed analysis method that correlates genetic modification to cell phenotype, specifically the identified knockout targets (δ fumC and δ sucC) and overexpression targets (ACC, PGK, GAPD and PDH) can cooperatively force carbon flux towards malonyl-CoA. The presented strategy can also be readily expanded for the production of other malonyl-CoA-derived compounds like polyketides and biofuels. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","[TITLE] genome-scale metabolic network modeling results in minimal interventions that cooperatively force carbon flux towards malonyl-coa [KEYWORDS] escherichia coli flavonoids malonyl-coa metabolic network modeling optforce synergistic effect [ABSTRACT] malonyl-coenzyme a is an important precursor metabolite for the biosynthesis of polyketides, flavonoids and biofuels. however, malonyl-coa naturally synthesized in microorganisms is consumed for the production of fatty acids and phospholipids leaving only a small amount available for the production of other metabolic targets in recombinant biosynthesis. here we present an integrated computational and experimental approach aimed at improving the intracellular availability of malonyl-coa in escherichia coli. we used a customized version of the recently developed optforce methodology to predict a minimal set of genetic interventions that guarantee a prespecified yield of malonyl-coa in e. coli strain bl21 star™. in order to validate the model predictions, we have successfully constructed an e. coli recombinant strain that exhibits a 4-fold increase in the levels of intracellular malonyl-coa compared to the wild type strain. furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of this e. coli strain for the production of plant-specific secondary metabolites naringenin (474. mg/l) with the highest yield ever achieved in a lab-scale fermentation process. combined effect of the genetic interventions was found to be synergistic based on a developed analysis method that correlates genetic modification to cell phenotype, specifically the identified knockout targets (δ fumc and δ succ) and overexpression targets (acc, pgk, gapd and pdh) can cooperatively force carbon flux towards malonyl-coa. the presented strategy can also be readily expanded for the production of other malonyl-coa-derived compounds like polyketides and biofuels. © 2011 elsevier inc."

The multinomial estimation shows that education, asset endowment, labor availability, and sex (male/female) of the household head play a vital role in livelihood diversification into non-agricultural sectors. Propensity score matching estimates illustrate that rural households diversifying outside agriculture have higher income and lower poverty levels compared to households pursuing only farming for their livelihoods. Livelihood diversification into non-farm activities can help reduce poverty levels in the range of 6–9 per cent, suggesting the importance of livelihood diversification in reducing poverty and increasing household income in Bhutan.","[TITLE] rural livelihood diversification strategies and household welfare in bhutan [KEYWORDS] bhutan income poverty propensity score matching rural livelihood [ABSTRACT] this paper analyzes rural livelihood diversification strategies and their impact on household welfare using the bhutan living standard survey 2012. the multinomial estimation shows that education, asset endowment, labor availability, and sex (male/female) of the household head play a vital role in livelihood diversification into non-agricultural sectors. propensity score matching estimates illustrate that rural households diversifying outside agriculture have higher income and lower poverty levels compared to households pursuing only farming for their livelihoods. livelihood diversification into non-farm activities can help reduce poverty levels in the range of 6–9 per cent, suggesting the importance of livelihood diversification in reducing poverty and increasing household income in bhutan."

Existence of strong connection between permanent energy supply and sustainable development is undeniable, and power plants are known as the main source of energy supply in the world. In this paper, energetic and exergetic analyses of a steam power plant are performed, and the effect of electrical load variations on energy and exergy efficiencies is studied. Load may decrease due to environmental considerations or operation of the power plant during the night, but the results show that lowering the load has negative effects on energy and exergy efficiencies, specific fuel consumption and CO2 production per unit of power. Moreover, exergy analysis reveals that turbine's control valves play a considerable role in exergy destruction of the power plant. Based on these results, an optimisation is proposed which makes the efficiencies, specific fuel consumption and carbon dioxide production per unit of power almost independent from the load variations.","[TITLE] exergy analysis and optimisation study of eliminating negative effects of electrical load variations in steam power plants [KEYWORDS] co2 production control valves energy exergy fossil fuels optimisation power plant specific fuel consumption sustainable development [ABSTRACT] energy consumption is increasing rapidly in the world, and sustainable development has been considered as one of the main goals for the countries. existence of strong connection between permanent energy supply and sustainable development is undeniable, and power plants are known as the main source of energy supply in the world. in this paper, energetic and exergetic analyses of a steam power plant are performed, and the effect of electrical load variations on energy and exergy efficiencies is studied. load may decrease due to environmental considerations or operation of the power plant during the night, but the results show that lowering the load has negative effects on energy and exergy efficiencies, specific fuel consumption and co2 production per unit of power. moreover, exergy analysis reveals that turbine's control valves play a considerable role in exergy destruction of the power plant. based on these results, an optimisation is proposed which makes the efficiencies, specific fuel consumption and carbon dioxide production per unit of power almost independent from the load variations."

A mixture of powdered RH and chopped CFs was molded into a slab by means of hot pressing without the use of any binders, after which some samples were subjected to a post-heating process. The physical properties of bulk density, Shore hardness, bending strength, and compressive strength of composites produced at different heating temperatures and various CF fractions were subsequently evaluated. The coefficient of kinetic friction and specific wear rate at the surfaces of these composites in contact with a SUS304 stainless steel ball were also ascertained. Unfilled (CF-free) composites heated to 1000°C displayed the greatest mechanical strength and optimal sliding properties, superior to the CF filled samples, resulting from the densification of the molded lignocellulosic elements in RH. However, this densification was accompanied by a large thermal shrinkage, causing a large molding error. The composite that contained 20% (by mass) CF and which was not subjected to a post-heating process turned out to be subject to only a minor molding error (∼1%), but was characterized by satisfactory mechanical and sliding properties: bulk density 1.19g/cm 3, Shore hardness 76.1HS, bending strength 41.2MPa, compressive strength 150.2MPa, kinetic friction coefficient 0.19, and specific wear rate of 2.6×10 -9mm 2/N.
