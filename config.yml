model:

  max_seq_length: 32                    # depends on your available GPU memory (in combination with batch size)
  num_classes: 3 #total number of different motions 
  #also remember to edit C:\Users\alanx\anaconda3\envs\law\Lib\site-packages\catalyst\utils\metrics file for the metrics change view() functions in reshape()

training:
  learn_rate: 2.5e-5                       # learning rate is typically ~1e-5 for transformers
  num_epochs: 3                          # smth around 2-6 epochs is typically fine when finetuning transformers
  accum_steps: 4                         # one optimization step for that many backward passes
  batch_size: 16                         # depends on your available GPU memory (in combination with max seq length)
